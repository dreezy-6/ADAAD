# ADAAD Android — Play Store Submission Runbook
# InnovativeAI LLC · Dustin L. Reid
# Version: 3.0.0 · March 2026

## Prerequisites

### 1. Google Play Developer Account
- Register at: https://play.google.com/console/signup
- One-time $25 registration fee
- Account name: **InnovativeAI LLC**
- Email: use the InnovativeAI business email (not personal)
- D-U-N-S number required for organization accounts → register at dnb.com if not yet obtained

### 2. Play Service Account for CI/CD
Create a service account so GitHub Actions can publish automatically:

1. Go to Play Console → Setup → API access
2. Link to a Google Cloud project (create if needed)
3. Create service account: play-store-publisher@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
4. Grant role: **Release Manager** (minimum for AAB upload)
5. Download JSON key → add as GitHub secret `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`

---

## Keystore Setup

### Store credentials in GitHub Secrets (Settings → Secrets → Actions):
```
ADAAD_KEYSTORE_BASE64   = base64 -w0 keystore/innovativeai-release.jks
ADAAD_STORE_PASSWORD    = <your storepass>
ADAAD_KEY_ALIAS         = adaad-release
ADAAD_KEY_PASSWORD      = <your keypass>  (same as storepass for PKCS12)
PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON = <contents of service account JSON>
```

### Enrol in Play App Signing (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)
Protects against keystore loss — Google holds the distribution key, you hold the upload key.
1. Play Console → Your app → Setup → App signing
2. Select "Use a key you upload (recommended for existing apps)" — or for first upload: "Use Google-managed key"
3. Export upload certificate:
   ```bash
   keytool -export -rfc \
     -keystore keystore/innovativeai-release.jks \
     -alias adaad-release \
     -storepass YOUR_STOREPASS \
     -file adaad-upload-cert.pem
   ```
4. Upload `adaad-upload-cert.pem` in Play Console

## First Upload — Manual (v3.0.0 internal track)

For the very first upload, do this manually (CI takes over after):

1. Build the AAB locally:
   ```bash
   export ADAAD_KEYSTORE_PATH=keystore/innovativeai-release.jks
   export ADAAD_STORE_PASSWORD=<your storepass>
   export ADAAD_KEY_ALIAS=adaad-release
   export ADAAD_KEY_PASSWORD=<same as storepass>
   ./gradlew bundleCommunityRelease
   ```
   Output: `app/build/outputs/bundle/communityRelease/app-community-release.aab`

2. Play Console → Testing → Internal testing → Create new release
3. Upload the `.aab` file
4. Release name: `3.0.0 (30000)`
5. Release notes: paste from `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/30000.txt`
6. Save and review → Start rollout to Internal testing

---

## Subsequent Releases — Automated via GitHub Actions

After the first manual upload, all subsequent releases are automated:

```bash
# Tag a release (triggers android-release.yml workflow)
git tag android-v3.0.1
git push origin android-v3.0.1
```

Or trigger manually from GitHub Actions → Android Release → Run workflow
- Select track: internal / alpha / beta / production
- Select flavor: community / developer / enterprise

### Track promotion strategy:
1. **Internal** → test with InnovativeAI team (up to 100 testers)
2. **Closed testing (alpha)** → Developer Preview cohort (S1 participants)
3. **Open testing (beta)** → Public Beta (S2 launch)
4. **Production** → GA launch (S3) — use staged rollout: 10% → 50% → 100%
