# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Claude-governed MCP co-pilot integration (feat/claude-mcp-copilot).
  New mcp-proposal-writer server (runtime/mcp/server.py): governed write
  surface for LLM mutation proposals. ClaudeProposalAgent implements
  MutatorAgent role. proposal_queue.py: append-only hash-linked staging.
  mutation_analyzer.py: deterministic fitness + constitutional pre-check.
  rejection_explainer.py: guard_report → plain-English explanation.
  candidate_ranker.py: fitness-weighted proposal ranking.
  tools_registry.py: MCP tools/list handler for all 4 servers.
  --serve-mcp flag added to ui/aponi_dashboard.py.
  .github/mcp_config.json: GitHub Copilot-compatible server configuration.

### Fixed
- CRITICAL: verify_signature() in security/cryovant.py now performs real
  HMAC-SHA-256 verification. Stub that always returned False removed.
- BLOCKING: --serve-mcp CLI flag now exists in ui/aponi_dashboard.py.

### Changed
- docs/CONSTITUTION.md: added LLM Proposal Agent governance clause.
- runtime/autonomy/roles.py: registered ClaudeProposalAgent.

### Changed
- Cryovant agent certificate checks now prefer payload-bound HMAC verification with legacy static/dev fallback telemetry during migration.
- Fixed constitution document version parsing regex so governance version-gate checks evaluate real markdown versions.
- Test sandbox pre-exec hooks are now invocation-scoped (thread-safe) instead of shared mutable instance state.
- `verify_session()` now emits a deprecation warning clarifying non-production behavior.
- Consolidated lineage chain resolution on `runtime.evolution.lineage_v2` and removed the duplicate `security.ledger.lineage_v2` implementation.
- Hardened replay-mode provider synchronization so `EvolutionRuntime.set_replay_mode()` aligns the epoch manager provider with the governor provider before strict replay checks.
- Improved deterministic shared-epoch concurrency behavior in governor validation ordering for strict replay lanes.
- Mutation executor now preserves backwards compatibility with legacy `_run_tests` monkeypatches that do not accept keyword args.
- Replay digest recomputation now tolerates historical/tampered chain analysis workflows by recomputing from recorded payloads without requiring hash-chain integrity prevalidation.
- Beast-mode loop explicit-agent cycles now consistently route through the legacy compatibility adapter path.
- Entropy baseline profiling CLI now bootstraps repository root imports automatically when invoked as `python tools/profile_entropy_baseline.py`.

- Added explicit verified vs unverified lineage incremental digest APIs to separate strict validation from forensic reconstruction workflows.
- Strict replay now emits warning metrics events when nonce format is malformed, improving replay auditability for concurrent validation lanes.
- Cryovant dev signature allowance remains explicitly gated by `CRYOVANT_DEV_MODE` opt-in semantics for local/dev workflows.
- Determinism foundation once again enforces deterministic providers for audit recovery tier (`audit_tier_requires_deterministic_provider`).
- Added Cryovant dev-signature acceptance telemetry (`cryovant_dev_signature_accepted`) for security visibility in dev-gated flows.
- Added strict replay invariants reference document under `docs/governance/STRICT_REPLAY_INVARIANTS.md`.
- Added shared-epoch strict replay stress coverage across repeated parallel runs to validate digest/order stability.
- Fixed a circular import between constitutional policy loading and metrics analysis by lazily importing lineage replay dependencies during determinism scoring.
- Metrics analysis lineage-ledger factory now supports explicit or `ADAAD_LINEAGE_PATH` path resolution, validates `LEDGER_V2_PATH` fallback, and creates parent directories before ledger initialization.
- Journal tail-state recovery now records deterministic warning metrics events when cached tail hashes require full-chain rescans.
- UX tools now include real-time CLI stage parsing, optional global error excepthook installer, expanded onboarding validation checks, and WebSocket-first enhanced dashboard updates with polling fallback.
- UX tooling refresh: richer enhanced dashboard visuals, expanded enhanced CLI terminal UX, comprehensive error dictionary formatting, and guided 8-step interactive onboarding.
- Added optional UX tooling package: enhanced static dashboard, enhanced CLI wrapper, interactive onboarding helper, and structured error dictionary for operator clarity.
- Aponi governance UI hardened with `Cache-Control: no-store` and CSP, plus externalized UI script delivery for non-inline execution compliance.
- Added deterministic replay-seed issuance/validation across governor, mutation executor, manifest schema, and manifest validator plus replay runtime parity integration tests.
- Replay, promotion manifest, baseline hashing, governor certificate fallback checkpoint digest, and law-evolution certificate hashing now use canonical runtime governance hashing/clock utilities.
- Runtime import root policy now explicitly allows `governance` compatibility adapters.
- Governance documentation now defines canonical runtime import paths and adapter expectations.
- Verbose boot diagnostics strengthened with replay mode normalization echo, fail-closed state output, replay score output, replay summary block, replay manifest path output, and explicit boot completion marker.
- `QUICKSTART.md` expanded with package sanity checks and first-time strict replay baseline guidance.
- Governance surfaces table in README and architecture legend in `docs/assets/architecture-simple.svg`.
- Bug template field for expected governance surface to accelerate triage.
- README clarified staging-only mutation semantics for production posture.
- CONTRIBUTING now requires strict replay verification for governance-impact PRs and adds determinism guardrails.
- Evolution kernel `run_cycle()` now supports a kernel-native execution path for explicit `agent_id` runs while preserving compatibility-adapter routing for default/no-agent flows.
- Hardened `EvolutionKernel` agent lookup by resolving discovered and requested paths before membership checks, eliminating alias/symlink/`..` false `agent_not_found` failures.
- Added regression coverage for mixed lexical-vs-resolved agent path forms in `tests/test_evolution_kernel.py`.
- Aponi execution-control now validates queue targets by command id, returning explicit `target_not_found` or `target_not_executable` errors before orchestration.

### Added
- Constitutional enforcement semantics now consistently apply enabled-rule gating with applicability pass-through (`rule_not_applicable`) and tier override resolution, improving deterministic verdict replay behavior.
- Replay/determinism posture updated for constitutional evaluation, increasing deterministic evidence surface while preserving reproducible policy-hash/version coupling across audits.
- Added read-only Aponi replay forensics endpoints (`/replay/divergence`, `/replay/diff?epoch_id=...`) and versioned governance health model metadata (`v1.0.0`).
- Added Aponi V2 governance docs: replay forensics + health model, red-team pressure scenario, and 0.70.0 draft release notes.
- Added epoch entropy observability helper (`runtime/evolution/telemetry_audit.py`) for declared vs observed entropy breakdown by epoch.
- Added fail-closed governance recovery runbook (`docs/governance/fail_closed_recovery_runbook.md`).
- Completed PR-5 sandbox hardening baseline: deterministic manifest/policy validation, syscall/fs/network/resource checks, and replayable sandbox evidence hashing.
- Added checkpoint registry and verifier modules, entropy policy/detector primitives, and hardened sandbox isolation evidence plumbing for PR-3/PR-4/PR-5 continuation.
- Added deterministic promotion event creation and priority-based promotion policy engine with unit tests.
- Mutation executor promotion integration now enforces valid transition edges and fail-closed policy rejection (`promotion_policy_rejected`).
- Completed PR-1 scoring foundation modules: deterministic scoring algorithm, scoring validator, and append-only scoring ledger with determinism tests.
- Added replay-safe determinism provider abstraction (`runtime.governance.foundation.determinism`) and wired provider injection through mutation executor, epoch manager, evolution governor, promotion manifest writer, and ledger snapshot recovery paths.
- Added governance schema validation policy, validator module/script, and draft-2020-12 governance schemas (`scoring_input`, `scoring_result`, `promotion_policy`, `checkpoint`, `manifest`) with tests.
- Deterministic governance foundation helpers under `runtime.governance.foundation` (`canonical`, `hashing`, `clock`) with compatibility adapters under top-level `governance.*`.
- Evolution governance helpers for deterministic checkpoint digests, promotion transition enforcement, and authority score clamping/threshold resolution.
- Unit tests covering governance foundation canonicalization/hash determinism and promotion state transitions.


### Security
- Enabled blocking constitutional checks for `lineage_continuity` and `resource_bounds`, strengthening mutation safety controls while retaining policy-defined tier behavior.
- Enabled warning-path governance checks for `max_complexity_delta` and `test_coverage_maintained`, and enforced `max_mutation_rate` tier escalation/demotion semantics for production/sandbox replay consistency.
