# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### ADAAD-10 — Live Market Signal Adapters (v1.4)

- **PR-10-01 — FeedRegistry + concrete adapters + schema:** `runtime/market/feed_registry.py` — deterministic adapter ordering, TTL caching, fail-closed stale guard, confidence-weighted composite score. `runtime/market/adapters/live_adapters.py` — `VolatilityIndexAdapter` (inverted market stress), `ResourcePriceAdapter` (normalised compute cost), `DemandSignalAdapter` (DAU/WAU/retention composite). `schemas/market_signal_reading.v1.json` — validated signal reading schema. 19 tests in `tests/market/test_feed_registry.py`.

### ADAAD-9 — Developer Experience (v1.3)

- **PR-9-03 — Phase 5: Simulation Panel Integration (D3):** `ui/aponi/simulation_panel.js` delivers the inline simulation panel within the Aponi IDE proposal editor workflow. Wires `POST /simulation/run` and `GET /simulation/results/{run_id}` (Epic 2 / ADAAD-8 endpoints) with pre-populated constitution constraint defaults from `/simulation/context`. Surfaces comparative outcomes (actual vs simulated, delta per metric) and provenance (deterministic flag, replay seed) inline without navigation. `ui/aponi/index.html` gains section '04 · Inline Simulation' with `proposalSimulationPanel`, `simulationRun`, `simulationResults` IDs (required by `test_simulation_submission_and_inline_result_rendering`). Android epoch range limit honoured from context. Authority invariant maintained: panel authors simulation requests only; execution authority remains with GovernanceGate.
- **PR-9-02 — Phase 4: Replay Inspector e2e test extension (D5):** `tests/test_aponi_dashboard_e2e.py` extended with 4 new inspector tests: epoch chain coverage (last-N epochs in `proof_status`), canonical digest surfacing in replay diff, divergence alert visual distinction markers, and lineage navigation from a mutation to its full ancestor chain. All tests verify the existing `replay_inspector.js` + `/replay/diff` + `/replay/divergence` surface against the EPIC_3 D5 acceptance criteria.
- **PR-9-01 — Phase 3: Evidence Viewer (D4):** `ui/aponi/evidence_viewer.js` delivers a read-only, bearer-auth-gated evidence bundle inspector within the Aponi IDE. Fetches from `GET /evidence/{bundle_id}` and renders provenance fields (`bundle_id`, `constitution_version`, `scoring_algorithm_version`, `governor_version`, fitness/goal hashes), risk summaries (with high-risk highlighting), export metadata with signer fields, sandbox snapshot, and replay proof chain. `ui/aponi/index.html` gains section 03 · Evidence Viewer and wires `evidence_viewer.js` and `proposal_editor.js` as separate script modules. `tests/test_evidence_viewer.py` added: 17 tests covering schema conformance against `schemas/evidence_bundle.v1.json`, provenance field presence, auth gating, determinism, and high-risk flag propagation.

### ADAAD-8 — Policy Simulation Mode (v1.2)

- **PR-10 — DSL Grammar + Constraint Interpreter:** `runtime/governance/simulation/constraint_interpreter.py` delivers `SimulationPolicy` (frozen dataclass, `simulation=True` structurally enforced) and `interpret_policy_block()`. 10 constraint types: approval thresholds, risk ceilings, rate limits, complexity deltas, tier lockdowns, rule assertions, coverage floors, entropy caps, reviewer escalation, lineage depth requirements. `schemas/governance_simulation_policy.v1.json` schema-enforces `simulation: true`. 50 tests.
- **PR-11 — Epoch Replay Simulator + Isolation Invariant:** `runtime/governance/simulation/epoch_simulator.py` delivers `EpochReplaySimulator` as a read-only substrate over `ReplayEngine`. `SimulationPolicy.simulation=True` checked at `GovernanceGate` boundary before any evaluation. Zero ledger writes, zero constitution state transitions, zero mutation executor calls during simulation. `EpochSimulationResult` and `SimulationRunResult` are frozen dataclasses with deterministic `policy_digest` and `run_digest`. 38 tests including explicit isolation assertion tests.
- **PR-12 — Aponi Simulation Endpoints:** `POST /simulation/run` and `GET /simulation/results/{run_id}` added to `server.py`. Both bearer-auth gated (`audit:read` scope). `simulation: true` structurally present in all responses. `simulation_only_notice` always in `POST` response. 422 on DSL parse error. 11 tests.
- **PR-13 — Governance Profile Exporter (milestone):** `runtime/governance/simulation/profile_exporter.py` exports `SimulationRunResult` + `SimulationPolicy` as self-contained `GovernanceProfile` artifacts. `schemas/governance_profile.v1.json` schema-enforces `simulation: true` and `profile_digest` SHA-256 format. Determinism guarantee: identical inputs → identical `profile_digest`. `validate_profile_schema()` performs structural + optional JSON schema validation. 23 tests.

### CI / Governance

- **PR-DOCS-01 — C-03 docs closure:** `docs/governance/FEDERATION_KEY_REGISTRY.md` governance doc published. Documents registry architecture, key format, rotation policy, threat model, and operator runbook for adding/revoking keys. PR-OPS-01 prerequisite satisfied before publication. C-03 docs lane closed.
- **PR-OPS-01 — H-07/M-02 closure:** Snapshot atomicity and sequence ordering hardened. `runtime/governance/branch_manager.py` uses `_atomic_copy()` for all snapshot writes. `runtime/recovery/ledger_guardian.py` enforces sequence-ordered snapshot iteration with `snapshot_ordering_fallback_to_mtime` as the tie-break policy. H-07 and M-02 findings closed.
- **PR-PERF-01 — C-04 closure:** Streaming lineage ledger verify path implemented. Lineage verification now streams ledger entries incrementally rather than loading the full ledger into memory, reducing peak memory consumption for large lineage chains. `runtime/evolution/` verify paths updated. C-04 finding closed.
- **PR-SECURITY-01 — C-03 closure:** Federation key pinning registry implemented. `governance/federation_trusted_keys.json` is the governance-signed source of truth for all trusted federation public keys. `runtime/governance/federation/key_registry.py` loads and caches the registry at process boot. `runtime/governance/federation/transport.py` `verify_message_signature()` now calls `get_trusted_public_key(key_id)` — caller-supplied key substitution attacks are closed. `FederationTransportContractError` raised for any unregistered `key_id`. C-03 finding closed. `docs/governance/FEDERATION_KEY_REGISTRY.md` governance doc published.
- **PR-HARDEN-01 — C-01/H-02 closure:** Boot env validation and signing key assertion hardened in `app/main.py` and `security/cryovant.py`. `ADAAD_GOVERNANCE_SESSION_SIGNING_KEY` presence is asserted at orchestrator boot in strict environments (`staging`, `production`, `prod`) with fail-closed `CRITICAL` log emission. `BootPreflightService.validate_cryovant()` wires `security.cryovant.validate_environment()` as a typed `StatusEnvelope` gate. C-01 and H-02 findings closed.
- **PR-LINT-01 — H-05 closure:** Determinism lint extended to `adaad/orchestrator/` (dispatcher, registry, bootstrap). `tools/lint_determinism.py` `TARGET_DIRS` and `ENTROPY_ENFORCED_PREFIXES` now include `adaad/orchestrator/`; `REQUIRED_GOVERNANCE_FILES` declares the four orchestrator modules. `determinism-lint` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` scans `adaad/orchestrator/` on every push/PR. `determinism_lint.yml` standalone workflow triggers on orchestrator path changes. H-05 finding closed.
- **PR-CI-01 — H-01 closure:** Unified Python version pin at `3.11.9` across all
  `.github/workflows/*.yml` files. `scripts/check_workflow_python_version.py` enforces
  the pin and is wired as a fail-closed CI guard. GA-1.1..GA-1.6 and GA-KR.1 controls
  confirmed complete in `docs/governance/ADAAD_7_GA_CLOSURE_TRACKER.md`.
- **PR-CI-02 — H-08 closure:** SPDX license header enforcement wired always-on as
  `spdx-header-lint` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. `scripts/check_spdx_headers.py`
  confirms all Python source files carry `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`.
  Fixed missing header in `tests/test_branch_protection_policy_workflow.py`.
  `docs/GOVERNANCE_ENFORCEMENT.md` required checks table updated. Claims evidence matrix
  `spdx-header-compliance` row marked Complete.

### Fixed
- Mutation fitness simulation now uses a deterministic structural DNA clone with `deepcopy` fallback, bounded LRU stable-hash score caching, agent-scoped cache keys within a shared bounded LRU cache, tuple-marker hash hardening, and a fail-closed simulation budget guard (resolved once at orchestrator boot); simulation fails closed when required DNA lineage is missing.
- Governance certifier now binds `token_ok` in pass/fail decisions and emits explicit `forbidden_token_detected` violations when token scan checks fail.
- Governance-critical auth call sites (`GateCertifier`, `ArchitectGovernor`) now use `verify_governance_token(...)` instead of deprecated `verify_session(...)`.
- Recovery tier auto-application now enforces explicit escalation/de-escalation semantics with recovery-window-gated de-escalation.

### Security
- Payload-bound legacy static signatures (`cryovant-static-*`) are now accepted only in explicit dev mode (`ADAAD_ENV=dev` + `CRYOVANT_DEV_MODE`) and rejected in non-dev mode with audit telemetry.
- Added deterministic production governance token contract (`cryovant-gov-v1`) via `sign_governance_token(...)` and `verify_governance_token(...)`.
- Governance token signer/verifier now rejects `key_id`/`nonce` delimiter ambiguity (`:`) for fail-closed token-structure validation.
- Deterministic-provider enforcement now covers governance-critical recovery tiers (`governance`, `critical`) while retaining `audit` alias compatibility.

### Added
- MCP schemas for proposal request/response and mutation analysis response under `schemas/mcp/`.

### ADAAD-9 Foundation
- Editor submission telemetry now emits `aponi_editor_proposal_submitted.v1` only for explicit Aponi editor request context headers, with actor/session metadata and no proposal body leakage.
- Aponi dashboard now serves replay inspector assets (`/ui/aponi/replay_inspector.js`) and exposes deterministic replay lineage drill-down metadata in `/replay/diff` responses (`lineage_chain`).
- Added governed simulation passthrough endpoints in standalone Aponi mode: `GET /simulation/context`, `POST /simulation/run`, and `GET /simulation/results/{run_id}` with constitution provenance and bounded epoch-range guardrails.
- Added deterministic `MutationLintingBridge` for editor preflight annotations and authenticated read-only evidence endpoint `GET /evidence/{bundle_id}` for Aponi evidence viewers.
- Added Aponi proposal-editor lint preview endpoint `GET /api/lint/preview` and explicit editor proposal journal event emission (`aponi_editor_proposal_submitted.v1`) on editor-origin submissions.
- MCP test coverage for tools parity, proposal validation, mutation analysis, rejection explanation, candidate ranking, and server route/auth contracts.

### Fixed

  tools_registry.py: MCP tools/list handler for all 4 servers.
  --serve-mcp flag added to ui/aponi_dashboard.py.
  .github/mcp_config.json: GitHub Copilot-compatible server configuration.

### Fixed
- CRITICAL: verify_signature() in security/cryovant.py now performs real
  HMAC-SHA-256 verification. Stub that always returned False removed.
- BLOCKING: --serve-mcp CLI flag now exists in ui/aponi_dashboard.py.

### Changed
- docs/CONSTITUTION.md: added LLM Proposal Agent governance clause.
- runtime/autonomy/roles.py: registered ClaudeProposalAgent.

### Changed
- Cryovant agent certificate checks now prefer payload-bound HMAC verification with legacy static/dev fallback telemetry during migration.

- Added shared-epoch strict replay stress coverage across repeated parallel runs to validate digest/order stability.
- Fixed a circular import between constitutional policy loading and metrics analysis by lazily importing lineage replay dependencies during determinism scoring.
- Metrics analysis lineage-ledger factory now supports explicit or `ADAAD_LINEAGE_PATH` path resolution, validates `LEDGER_V2_PATH` fallback, and creates parent directories before ledger initialization.
- Journal tail-state recovery now records deterministic warning metrics events when cached tail hashes require full-chain rescans.
- UX tools now include real-time CLI stage parsing, optional global error excepthook installer, expanded onboarding validation checks, and WebSocket-first enhanced dashboard updates with polling fallback.
- UX tooling refresh: richer enhanced dashboard visuals, expanded enhanced CLI terminal UX, comprehensive error dictionary formatting, and guided 8-step interactive onboarding.
- Added optional UX tooling package: enhanced static dashboard, enhanced CLI wrapper, interactive onboarding helper, and structured error dictionary for operator clarity.
- Aponi governance UI hardened with `Cache-Control: no-store` and CSP, plus externalized UI script delivery for non-inline execution compliance.
- Added deterministic replay-seed issuance/validation across governor, mutation executor, manifest schema, and manifest validator plus replay runtime parity integration tests.

- `QUICKSTART.md` expanded with package sanity checks and first-time strict replay baseline guidance.
- Governance surfaces table in README and architecture legend in `docs/assets/architecture-simple.svg`.
- Bug template field for expected governance surface to accelerate triage.
- README clarified staging-only mutation semantics for production posture.
- CONTRIBUTING now requires strict replay verification for governance-impact PRs and adds determinism guardrails.
- Evolution kernel `run_cycle()` now supports a kernel-native execution path for explicit `agent_id` runs while preserving compatibility-adapter routing for default/no-agent flows.
- Hardened `EvolutionKernel` agent lookup by resolving discovered and requested paths before membership checks, eliminating alias/symlink/`..` false `agent_not_found` failures.
- Added regression coverage for mixed lexical-vs-resolved agent path forms in `tests/test_evolution_kernel.py`.
- Aponi execution-control now validates queue targets by command id, returning explicit `target_not_found` or `target_not_executable` errors before orchestration.

### Added
- Constitutional enforcement semantics now consistently apply enabled-rule gating with applicability pass-through (`rule_not_applicable`) and tier override resolution, improving deterministic verdict replay behavior.
- Replay/determinism posture updated for constitutional evaluation, increasing deterministic evidence surface while preserving reproducible policy-hash/version coupling across audits.
- Added read-only Aponi replay forensics endpoints (`/replay/divergence`, `/replay/diff?epoch_id=...`) and versioned governance health model metadata (`v1.0.0`).
- Added Aponi V2 governance docs: replay forensics + health model, red-team pressure scenario, and 0.70.0 draft release notes.
- Added epoch entropy observability helper (`runtime/evolution/telemetry_audit.py`) for declared vs observed entropy breakdown by epoch.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-05 · ADAAD-9 Developer Experience

### ADAAD-9 · Aponi-as-IDE — Governance-First Developer Environment

Aponi evolves from a read-only governance observatory into a **governance-first authoring environment**. Developers can now author, lint, simulate, and inspect evidence for mutation proposals entirely within a single browser-accessible interface — without departing to a second toolchain.

**D1 — Mutation Proposal Editor:** `ui/aponi/proposal_editor.js` routes proposals through `POST /mutation/propose`; emits `aponi_editor_proposal_submitted.v1` journal event on every editor-originated submission.

**D2 — Inline Constitutional Linter:** `runtime/mcp/linting_bridge.py` (`MutationLintingBridge`) wraps `mutation_analyzer.py`; debounced 800ms; uses same rule engine as `GovernanceGate`; `AndroidMonitor.should_throttle()` governs call frequency; determinism tests in `tests/mcp/test_linting_bridge.py`.

**D3 — Simulation Panel:** `ui/aponi/simulation_panel.js`; wires Epic 2 `POST /simulation/run` + `GET /simulation/results/{run_id}`; pre-populates constraints from `/simulation/context`; surfaces comparative outcomes (actual/simulated/delta) and provenance (deterministic, replay_seed) inline.

**D4 — Evidence Viewer:** `ui/aponi/evidence_viewer.js`; fetches `GET /evidence/{bundle_id}`; renders provenance fields (`constitution_version`, `scoring_algorithm_version`, `governor_version`, hashes), risk summaries with high-risk highlight, signer fields, sandbox snapshot, replay proof chain. 17 tests in `tests/test_evidence_viewer.py` covering schema conformance, auth gating, provenance presence, determinism.

**D5 — Replay Inspector:** `ui/aponi/replay_inspector.js` over `/replay/divergence` + `/replay/diff`; navigable epoch-by-epoch transition chain; divergence alert distinction; lineage navigation from mutation to full ancestor chain. 4 new e2e tests in `tests/test_aponi_dashboard_e2e.py`.

**D6 — Android/Pydroid3 Compatibility:** All heavy operations (simulation, evidence fetch) respect `AndroidMonitor.should_throttle()`; epoch range bounded by platform limit from `/simulation/context`.

**Authority invariant:** Aponi IDE introduces no new execution path. All write operations route through `POST /mutation/propose` → MCP queue → `GovernanceGate` → constitutional evaluation → staging. `authority_level` clamped to `governor-review` by `proposal_validator.py` for all editor-originated submissions.
