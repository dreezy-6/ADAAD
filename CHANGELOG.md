# Changelog

## [3.1.0-dev] — 2026-03-07 · PR-PHASE6-03 · M6-04 Federated Roadmap Propagation Complete

### Phase 6 · M6-04 Completion (post-merge close-out)

**PR-PHASE6-03** is complete: `FederationMutationBroker.propagate_amendment()` now
ships atomic all-or-nothing propagation, destination-side independent gate checks,
and ledger emission for `federated_amendment_propagated`.

**Constitutional invariants satisfied:**
- `INVARIANT PHASE6-FED-0` — source-node approval is provenance-only and never binds destination nodes.
- `INVARIANT PHASE6-STORM-0` — propagation path remains compatible with per-node pending-amendment limits.
- `INVARIANT PHASE6-HUMAN-0` — no autonomous merge/sign-off authority introduced.

**Evidence alignment:**
- `docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md` row `phase6-m604-federated-propagation` marked `Complete` with final implementation/test/evidence links.
- `docs/governance/ledger_event_contract.md` payload contract for `federated_amendment_propagated` verified against runtime implementation fields.

## [3.1.0-dev] — 2026-03-07 · PR-PHASE6-02 · M6-03 EvolutionLoop × RoadmapAmendmentEngine Wire

### Phase 6 · M6-03 Implementation

**PR-PHASE6-02** ships the M6-03 milestone: `RoadmapAmendmentEngine` is wired
into `EvolutionLoop` at the post-epoch-N checkpoint behind a 6-gate prerequisite
check. No amendment proposal is emitted unless all gates pass.

**Files changed:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `runtime/evolution/evolution_loop.py` | `_evaluate_m603_amendment_gates()` inserted at epoch checkpoint; `EpochResult` extended with `amendment_proposed: bool` and `amendment_id: Optional[str]` |
| `runtime/autonomy/roadmap_amendment_engine.py` | `list_pending()` storm-guard method — enforces `INVARIANT PHASE6-STORM-0` (at most 1 pending amendment per node) |
| `tests/autonomy/test_evolution_loop_amendment.py` | T6-03-01..13 acceptance test suite (13 tests) |
| `docs/governance/ledger_event_contract.md` | 6 Phase 6 ledger event types registered |
| `docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` | `ADAAD_ROADMAP_AMENDMENT_TRIGGER_INTERVAL` documented |
| `docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md` | `phase6-m603-evolution-loop-wire` evidence row |

**Constitutional invariants enforced:**
- `INVARIANT PHASE6-AUTH-0` — `authority_level` immutable after construction
- `INVARIANT PHASE6-STORM-0` — `list_pending()` gate blocks storm condition
- `INVARIANT PHASE6-HUMAN-0` — no auto-approval path present

**CI jobs added:** `phase6-amendment-gate-determinism` · `phase6-storm-invariant` · `phase6-human-signoff-path`

## [3.1.0-dev] — 2026-03-07 · ArchitectAgent Phase 6 Completion Specification

### Governance — ArchitectAgent Specification v3.1.0

ArchitectAgent has issued the authoritative constitutional specification for Phase 6
completion, covering M6-03 (EvolutionLoop × RoadmapAmendmentEngine wire), M6-04
(Federated Roadmap Propagation), and M6-05 (Android Distribution close).

**New governance artifacts:**

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docs/governance/ARCHITECT_SPEC_v3.1.0.md` | Canonical Phase 6 completion spec — PR gates, invariants, failure modes, acceptance criteria |
| `docs/governance/ADAAD_PR_PROCESSION_2026-03.md` (addendum) | PR-PHASE6-02, PR-PHASE6-03, PR-PHASE6-04 definitions + v3.1.0 tag gate |
| `ROADMAP.md` (updated) | M6-03 and M6-04 assigned to PR-PHASE6-02 and PR-PHASE6-03 |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md` (updated) | Canonical spec pointer updated to v3.1.0 |

**New constitutional invariants (Phase 6 additions):**
- `INVARIANT PHASE6-AUTH-0` — `authority_level` immutable on amendment proposals
- `INVARIANT PHASE6-STORM-0` — at most 1 pending amendment per node
- `INVARIANT PHASE6-HUMAN-0` — human sign-off non-delegatable for amendments
- `INVARIANT PHASE6-FED-0` — source approval never binds destination nodes
- `INVARIANT PHASE6-APK-0` — every APK passes governance gate before signing

**Phase 6 PR sequence now governed:**
```
PR-PHASE6-02  →  PR-PHASE6-03  →  PR-PHASE6-04  →  v3.1.0 tag
  (M6-03)          (M6-04)         (M6-05 close)
```

## [3.1.0-dev] — 2026-03-06 · Phase 6 + Free Android Distribution

### PR-PHASE6-01 · ArchitectAgent Constitutional Spec v3.1.0 + Phase 6 Governance Foundations

**ArchitectAgent deliverable — no code generated. All outputs are governance specifications,
machine-interpretable invariants, and audit-ready architectural blueprints.**

**New governance documents:**

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `docs/governance/ARCHITECT_SPEC_v3.1.0.md` | Canonical Phase 6 constitutional specification — 18 constitutional rules, Founders Law amendment `FL-ROADMAP-SIGNOFF-V1`, complete subsystem blueprints for M6-02/M6-03/M6-04/M6-05, all Phase 6 failure modes |
| `docs/governance/ledger_event_contract.md` §8 | Phase 6 roadmap amendment event type registration — 7 new event types with required payload schemas |
| `docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` | `ADAAD_ROADMAP_AMENDMENT_TRIGGER_INTERVAL` registered — default `'10'`, min-1 enforced at boot |
| `docs/governance/SECURITY_INVARIANTS_MATRIX.md` | Phase 6 security invariants appended — 12 new invariants covering authority, storage, human sign-off, anti-manipulation, and federated amendment |

**Constitutional invariants issued (Phase 6 additions to 18-rule set):**
- Rule 17: `roadmap_mutation_human_signoff_required` — BLOCKING — halts any ROADMAP.md modification without human sign-off
- Rule 18: `amendment_no_auto_merge` — BLOCKING — no automated merge path for roadmap amendments
- Founders Law: `FL-ROADMAP-SIGNOFF-V1` — new blocking rule in `DEFAULT_LAW_RULES`

**Phase 6 PR sequence authorised:**

| PR | Milestone | CI Tier | Human Sign-off |
|----|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `PR-PHASE6-02` | M6-03 EvolutionLoop wire | critical | **REQUIRED** |
| `PR-PHASE6-03` | M6-04 Federated propagation | critical | **REQUIRED per node** |
| `PR-PHASE6-04` | M6-05 Distribution complete | standard | Required (F-Droid MR) |
| **v3.1.0 tag** | Phase 6 GA | — | **REQUIRED** |



The mutation engine can now propose, score, and submit governed amendments to
ROADMAP.md itself. All proposals are constitutional-gated (authority_level =
`governor-review`), require ≥2 human governor approvals, and are deterministically
replayable via `verify_replay()`.

**New modules:**

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `runtime/autonomy/roadmap_amendment_engine.py` | `RoadmapAmendmentEngine` — propose, approve, reject, replay-verify roadmap amendments |
| `runtime/autonomy/proposal_diff_renderer.py` | `render_proposal_diff()` — Markdown diff output for Aponi IDE and PR descriptions |
| `tests/autonomy/test_roadmap_amendment_engine.py` | 22 acceptance-criteria tests covering scoring, authority invariants, determinism, and terminal states |

**Authority invariants:**
- `authority_level` is hardcoded to `"governor-review"` and cannot be injected by any agent
- No change to ROADMAP.md occurs without 2 governor approvals + human-approval gate sign-off
- Every proposal carries a `lineage_chain_hash` (SHA-256 of prior_roadmap_hash + content_hash)
- `DeterminismViolation` raised on replay hash divergence — proposal halts, no commit

**Acceptance criteria shipped:**
- `diff_score ∈ [0.0, 1.0]` enforced on every proposal
- `GovernanceViolation` on short rationale (< 10 words) or invalid milestone status
- Double-approval by same governor rejected
- Terminal status (APPROVED/REJECTED) blocks further transitions
- JSON round-trip deterministic across 100% of test scenarios

## [3.0.0] — 2026-03-06

### Phase 5 — Multi-Repo Federation (SHIPPED)

#### PR-PHASE5-01: HMAC Key Validation (M-05)
- **New:** `runtime/governance/federation/key_registry.py` enforces minimum-length HMAC key at boot
- **New:** Boot halts with `FederationKeyError` if key material is absent or below minimum threshold (fail-closed)
- `tests/governance/federation/test_federation_hmac_key_validation.py` — 100% branch coverage

#### PR-PHASE5-02: Cross-Repo Lineage (`federation_origin`)
- **New:** `LineageLedgerV2` extended with `federation_origin: FederationOrigin | None` field
- **New:** Mutations carrying federated origin are traceable to source-repo epoch chain; origin preserved across serialization round-trips
- `tests/test_lineage_federation_origin.py` — replay-stable verification

#### PR-PHASE5-03: FederationMutationBroker
- **New:** `runtime/governance/federation/mutation_broker.py` — governed cross-repo mutation propagation
- **New:** `GovernanceGate.approve_mutation()` required in BOTH source and destination repos before any federated mutation is accepted
- Fail-closed: any gate failure in either repo rejects the federated proposal unconditionally
- `tests/test_federation_mutation_broker.py`

#### PR-PHASE5-04: FederatedEvidenceMatrix
- **New:** `runtime/governance/federation/federated_evidence_matrix.py` — cross-repo determinism verification gate
- **New:** Release gate output includes `federated_evidence` section; `divergence_count > 0` blocks promotion
- `tests/test_federated_evidence_matrix.py`

#### PR-PHASE5-05: EvolutionFederationBridge + ProposalTransportAdapter
- **New:** `runtime/governance/federation/evolution_federation_bridge.py` — lifecycle wiring: broker and evidence matrix initialised and torn down with `EvolutionRuntime`
- **New:** `runtime/governance/federation/proposal_transport_adapter.py` — flush/receive proposals via `FederationTransport`
- `tests/test_evolution_federation_bridge.py`, `tests/test_proposal_transport_adapter.py`

#### PR-PHASE5-06: Federated Evidence Bundle + Release Gate
- **New:** `runtime/evolution/evidence_bundle.py` extended: `federated_evidence` section emitted in release gate output
- **New:** Release gate fails if `federated_evidence.divergence_count > 0`
- `tests/test_evidence_bundle_federated.py`

#### PR-PHASE5-07: Federation Determinism CI + HMAC Key Rotation Runbook
- **New:** `.github/workflows/federation_determinism.yml` — Phase 5 required CI gate enforcing 0-divergence invariant on every PR touching federation runtime, evidence bundle, governance gate, or federation tests
- **New:** `docs/runbooks/hmac_key_rotation.md` — operational runbook for HMAC key rotation in production federation deployments

### Summary
Phase 5 completes the multi-repo federation architecture described in the ADAAD roadmap. Every federated mutation now requires dual GovernanceGate approval, carries cross-repo lineage provenance, and is blocked by the FederatedEvidenceMatrix if any determinism divergence is detected. The federation_determinism CI job enforces these invariants on every PR. Phase 6 (Autonomous Roadmap Self-Amendment) is promoted to active.


## [2.3.0] — 2026-03-06

### Phase 4 — AST-Aware Scoring + Pipeline Intelligence (SHIPPED)

#### PR-PHASE4-02: SemanticDiffEngine wired into scoring pipeline
- **New:** `MutationFitnessEvaluator.evaluate()` enriches code_diff with AST-derived risk/complexity via `enrich_code_diff_with_semantic()` when `python_content` is available
- **New:** `scoring_algorithm_version: "semantic_diff_v1.0"` injected into every scored payload
- **New:** `EpochResult.semantic_scored_count` + `scoring_algorithm_version` fields
- Graceful degradation: falls back to v1 LOC heuristics on SyntaxError or parse failure
- Backward-compatible: all existing scoring consumers unaffected

#### PR-PHASE4-03: MutationRouteOptimizer — Phase 2.5 pre-scoring gate
- **New:** `EvolutionLoop.run_epoch()` Phase 2.5: routes each candidate (TRIVIAL / STANDARD / ELEVATED) before deep scoring
- **New:** ELEVATED mutations annotated in `EpochResult.elevated_mutation_ids` for human-review
- **New:** TRIVIAL count reported in `EpochResult.trivial_fast_pathed`
- **New:** `mutation_route_decision` ledger event emitted per epoch
- Fail-graceful: routing errors never halt the epoch

#### PR-PHASE4-04: EntropyFastGate — Phase 1.5 entropy preflight
- **New:** Phase 1.5 preflight: proposals containing nondeterministic sources (random, uuid, time.time, os.urandom) scanned before seeding
- **New:** DENY → proposal quarantined, `entropy_gate_quarantine` ledger event emitted
- **New:** `EpochResult.entropy_quarantined` + `entropy_warned` fields
- Strict mode by default (`strict=True`): nondeterministic proposals never reach population

#### PR-PHASE4-05: CheckpointChain — epoch transition anchoring
- **New:** `EvolutionLoop.__init__` loads and verifies `data/checkpoint_chain.jsonl` at boot — halts on integrity failure (fail-closed)
- **New:** Phase 5c: every epoch anchored to running `CheckpointChain` (append-only JSONL, hash-linked)
- **New:** `EpochResult.checkpoint_digest` — chain_digest of the new epoch link
- Chain integrity check via `verify_checkpoint_chain()` at boot; tampering → `RuntimeError`

#### PR-PHASE4-06: ParallelGovernanceGate — concurrent axis evaluation
- **New:** `GateDecision.gate_mode: str` field (`"serial"` | `"parallel"`) in all ledger events
- **New:** `GovernanceGate.approve_mutation(parallel=True)` delegates to `ParallelGovernanceGate.approve_mutation_parallel()`
- Serial path fully backward-compatible (default `parallel=False`)
- Parallel fallback: any failure reverts to serial (fail-safe)

#### PR-PHASE4-07: Lineage confidence scoring + semantic determinism CI
- **New:** `LineageLedgerV2.semantic_proximity_score()` — cosine similarity in (risk, complexity) 2D space against rolling mean of last 10 accepted mutations
  - `proximity_bonus ∈ [0.0, 0.15]` — semantic similarity to accepted lineage
  - `exploration_bonus ∈ [0.0, 0.10]` — semantic novelty reward
- **New:** `EpochResult.mean_lineage_proximity` — mean lineage score for accepted mutations
- **New CI job:** `semantic-diff-determinism` — 10 fixed AST fixture proofs on every push

[2.2.0] — 2026-03-06

### Phase 2 — Governed Explore/Exploit Loop (SHIPPED)

#### PR-PHASE2-01: ExploreExploitController
- **New:** `runtime/autonomy/explore_exploit_controller.py` — governed mode switching between Explore (breadth-first) and Exploit (depth-first refinement)
- Constitutional invariant: `MIN_EXPLORE_RATIO = 0.20` — hard floor enforced at every epoch (≥20% epochs must be EXPLORE)
- `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_EXPLOIT = 4` — automatic EXPLORE reversion after 4 consecutive EXPLOIT epochs
- Transition priority order: human_override > plateau_detected > consecutive_limit > explore_floor > score_threshold > default_explore
- Plateau detection wired: `FitnessLandscape.is_plateau()` triggers forced EXPLORE
- Every mode transition emits a signed `ModeTransitionEvent` to audit ledger
- State persisted as JSON across epochs; reloads cleanly across restarts
- Audit writer failure never blocks mode selection (fail-open on audit only)
- **Tests: 23 ExploreExploitController tests passing**

#### PR-PHASE2-02: HumanApprovalGate
- **New:** `runtime/governance/human_approval_gate.py` — structural human-in-the-loop approval gate
- Lifecycle: PENDING → APPROVED/REJECTED → REVOKED (append-only; no in-place mutation)
- `is_approved()` is the canonical fail-closed gate check: returns False for pending, rejected, revoked, and unknown mutations
- `batch_approve()` for L2+ per-generation review cadence
- Every approval/rejection/revocation is signed with SHA-256 digest and appended to immutable audit ledger
- `audit_trail()` filterable by mutation_id for full provenance
- Audit writer failure never blocks approval decisions
- **Tests: 22 HumanApprovalGate tests passing**

#### PR-PHASE2-03: LineageDAG
- **New:** `runtime/evolution/lineage_dag.py` — multi-generational directed acyclic graph for G0→G7+ lineage tracking
- `add_node()`: validates parent existence, generation correctness (parent.gen+1), max depth (G20), and promoted⟹approved invariant
- `promote_node()`: immutable promotion record appended to JSONL; in-memory state updated
- `get_lineage_chain()`: full ancestor trace from any node back to G0
- `compare_branches()`: fitness delta + common ancestor + generation distance between two subtrees
- `generation_summary()`: per-generation statistics (node_count, avg_fitness, top_node, approved/promoted counts)
- `integrity_check()`: SHA-256 rolling chain verified from genesis to current tip
- `health_snapshot()`: governance-ready summary including approval_rate, promotion_rate, chain_digest
- Full persistence: JSONL append-only log with promotion events as distinct record type
- **Tests: 22 LineageDAG tests passing**

#### PR-PHASE2-04: PhaseTransitionGate
- **New:** `runtime/governance/phase_transition_gate.py` — governed autonomy level advancement (L0→L4)
- 5-criteria gate per phase: min_approved_mutations, min_mutation_pass_rate, min_lineage_completeness, audit_chain_intact, min_consecutive_clean_epochs
- Phase skip enforcement: transitions can only advance by exactly one level
- `evaluate_gate()`: read-only multi-criteria evaluation with per-criterion `CriterionResult`
- `attempt_transition()`: commits transition if gate passes; always writes audit record
- `record_epoch_outcome()`: tracks consecutive clean epochs; dirty epoch resets counter to zero
- `demote_phase()`: immediate operator rollback to any lower phase, no criteria required
- `PHASE_GATE_CRITERIA` monotonically increasing requirements (Phase 4 requires 100% lineage completeness)
- All transitions write signed audit records to append-only JSONL
- **Tests: 35 PhaseTransitionGate tests passing**

#### PR-PHASE2-05: EvolutionLoop wiring
- `EvolutionLoop` wired with `ExploreExploitController` — injected via optional `controller` kwarg (test-safe)
- `EpochResult` extended: `evolution_mode` (str) and `window_explore_ratio` (float) fields added
- Phase 0b injection in `run_epoch()`: mode selected before proposal phase; committed after landscape recording
- `controller.commit_epoch()` called after every epoch with actual mode used
- Backward-compatible: all existing `EpochResult` consumers unaffected (new fields have defaults)
- **Tests: 5 integration tests passing**

### Summary
- **102 new tests passing** (23 + 22 + 22 + 35 + 5 = 102) — zero regressions on existing test suite
- All modules: pure Python stdlib, Android/Pydroid3 compatible
- All audit writers: fail-open on external ledger failures; core operations never blocked by audit unavailability
- Constitutional invariant coverage: MIN_EXPLORE_RATIO, MAX_CONSECUTIVE_EXPLOIT, phase-skip prevention, promoted⟹approved, G20 depth cap, 100% lineage requirement at L4

**PR-EVOLUTION-02: Epoch Telemetry Engine + Weekly Analytics CI**
- `runtime/autonomy/epoch_telemetry.py` — Append-only epoch analytics engine
  Collects: acceptance rate series, rolling mean, weight trajectory, agent distribution,
  plateau events, bandit activation epoch, 5 health indicators
- `tools/epoch_analytics.py` — CLI report generator with `--summary`, `--health`,
  `--fail-on-warning` (CI gate), `--output` flags; exit codes: 0/1/2/3
- `.github/workflows/epoch_analytics.yml` — Weekly CI (Monday 06:00 UTC):

### Repository Hardening — v2.0.0 (2026-03-06)

**Structural simplification**
- Moved 9 historical planning docs from root to `docs/archive/` (EPIC_*.md, ADAAD_7_EXECUTION_PLAN.md, ADAAD_DEEP_DIVE_AUDIT.md, MILESTONE_ROADMAP_ADAAD6-9.md, MERGE_READY_REVIEW_COMMENT_BLOCK.md, PR_v1.0.0_body.md)
- Moved `GOVERNANCE_RISK_SIGNOFF_MEMO.md` from root to `docs/governance/` (canonical governance path)
- Consolidated ephemeral PR comment files from `comments/` and `pr_comments/` into `docs/archive/pr_comments/`

## [2.0.0] — 2026-03-06 · AI Mutation Capability Expansion

### Principal/Staff Engineer Grade Implementation

Six-file capability expansion delivering the first functional AI mutation pipeline for ADAAD. Every sub-system that was stub-level or statically hardcoded is now a production-ready, self-improving, lineage-tracked engine.

**mutation_scaffold.py — v2 Upgrade (MODIFY)**
- Added `ScoringWeights` dataclass: externally-injectable, epoch-scoped weight bundle replacing hardcoded float constants. Owned by `WeightAdaptor`, consumed as pure input by the scoring engine.
- Added `PopulationState` dataclass: GA-epoch bookkeeping (generation counter, elite roster, diversity pressure signal). Owned by `PopulationManager`.
- Extended `MutationCandidate` with five lineage fields (`parent_id`, `generation`, `agent_origin`, `epoch_id`, `source_context_hash`) — all `Optional` with defaults, 100% backward-compatible with existing 5-positional-arg constructors.
- Adaptive acceptance threshold: `adjusted_threshold = base_threshold × (1 - diversity_pressure × 0.4)`. Exploration epochs become more permissive automatically.
- Elitism bonus: `+0.05` score applied post-threshold-adjustment for children of elite-roster parents (lineage reward).
- `MutationScore` extended with `epoch_id`, `parent_id`, `agent_origin`, `elitism_applied` for full DAG traceability.

**ai_mutation_proposer.py — NEW**
- Connects the Claude API (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) to the mutation pipeline for the first time.
- Three agent personas with engineered system prompts: Architect (structural, low-medium risk), Dream (experimental, high-gain), Beast (conservative, coverage/performance).
- `CodebaseContext` dataclass with stable MD5 `context_hash()` for lineage binding.
- Pure `urllib.request` — zero third-party deps, Android/Pydroid3 safe.
- Markdown fence stripping (```json...```) for Claude formatting non-compliance robustness.
- `propose_from_all_agents()` as primary EvolutionLoop entry point.

**weight_adaptor.py — NEW**
- Momentum-based coordinate descent (`LR=0.05`, `momentum=0.85`) on `gain_weight` and `coverage_weight`.
- Rolling EMA prediction accuracy (`alpha=0.3`) tracking correct-prediction rate.
- `risk_penalty` and `complexity_penalty` remain static (Phase 2 — requires post-merge telemetry).
- JSON persistence to `data/weight_adaptor_state.json` after every `adapt()` call.
- `MIN_WEIGHT=0.05`, `MAX_WEIGHT=0.70` bounds enforced via clamp — no weight ever zeroed or dominated.

**fitness_landscape.py — NEW**
- Persistent per-mutation-type win/loss ledger with `TypeRecord` dataclasses.
- Plateau detection: all tracked types with `>= 3` attempts below `20%` win rate → switch to Dream.
- Agent recommendation decision tree: plateau→dream, structural wins→architect, perf/coverage wins→beast.
- JSON persistence to `data/fitness_landscape_state.json`.
- Extension point documented: UCB1/Thompson Sampling bandit selector (Phase 2).

**population_manager.py — NEW**
- GA-style population evolution: seed → elitism → BLX-alpha crossover → diversity enforcement → cap.
- BLX-alpha=0.5 crossover: result range `[lo-extent, hi+extent]` with `extent=(hi-lo)×0.5`.
- `MAX_POPULATION=12`, `ELITE_SIZE=3`, `CROSSOVER_RATE=0.4`.
- MD5 fingerprint deduplication (4 fields, 3 d.p.) prevents near-duplicate population lock-in.
- Crossover children inherit `parent_id=parent_a.mutation_id` for elitism bonus eligibility.

**evolution_loop.py — NEW**
- Five-phase epoch orchestrator: Strategy → Propose → Seed → Evolve → Adapt → Record.
- `EpochResult` dataclass: `epoch_id`, `generation_count`, `total_candidates`, `accepted_count`, `top_mutation_ids`, `weight_accuracy`, `recommended_next_agent`, `duration_seconds`.
- `simulate_outcomes=True` mode derives synthetic outcomes from scored population for unit testing without CI integration.
- Graceful degradation: `propose_from_all_agents()` failure captured, empty population handled cleanly.

**adaad/core/health.py — PR #12 FIX**
- `gate_ok` field now always present in health payload (was missing, blocking PR #12 merge).
- Default `gate_ok=True` for backward compatibility; Orchestrator overrides via `extra` dict.
- New `gate_ok` kwarg on `health_report()` for explicit governance gate injection.
- All v1 health payload fields (`status`, `timestamp_iso`, `timestamp_unix`, `timestamp`) preserved.

**Tests (44 new, 0 regressions)**
- `tests/test_mutation_scaffold_v2.py`: 8 tests — v1 compat, weight defaults, adaptive threshold, elitism, lineage, state advance, elite cap, rank kwargs.
- `tests/test_fitness_landscape.py`: 6 tests — record, plateau, sparse guard, dream recommendation, architect recommendation, persistence.
- `tests/test_weight_adaptor.py`: 6 tests — defaults, accuracy convergence, bounds, noop, persistence, momentum smoothing.
- `tests/test_ai_mutation_proposer.py`: 8 tests — proposals, origin, fence stripping, invalid agent, parent_id, context hash, all agents, malformed JSON.
- `tests/test_population_manager.py`: 6 tests — BLX range, lineage, dedup, max cap, elite ids, generation advance.
- `tests/test_evolution_loop.py`: 5 integration tests — EpochResult, accepted count, weight accuracy, landscape recording, agent recommendation.
- `tests/test_pr12_gate_ok.py`: 5 tests — presence, default, override, kwarg, backward compat.


### ADAAD-14 — Cross-Track Convergence (v1.8)

- **PR-14-03 — MarketDrivenContainerProfiler: market × container convergence:** `runtime/sandbox/market_driven_profiler.py` — `MarketDrivenContainerProfiler` uses `score_provider` callable (wrapping `FeedRegistry` or `FederatedSignalBroker`) to select `ContainerProfileTier` (CONSTRAINED / STANDARD / BURST); thresholds: <0.35 → CONSTRAINED (cpu=25%, mem=128MB), ≥0.65 → BURST (cpu=80%, mem=512MB); confidence guard (below 0.30 → STANDARD forced, `overridden=True`); `ProfileSelection` dataclass with lineage digest + journal event; `profile_for_slot()` convenience returning resource dict directly. Two new container profiles: `container_profiles/market_constrained.json` + `market_burst.json`. Factory helpers: `make_profiler_from_feed_registry()` + `make_profiler_from_federated_broker()`. Authority invariant: profiler is advisory; ContainerOrchestrator retains pool authority. 22 tests in `tests/test_market_driven_profiler.py`.

: Darwinian × federation convergence:** `runtime/evolution/budget/cross_node_arbitrator.py` — `CrossNodeBudgetArbitrator` merges peer fitness reports (via `FederationBudgetGossip` + `GossipProtocol`) with local `BudgetArbitrator` for cluster-wide Softmax reallocation; `PeerFitnessReport` with 45 s freshness TTL; `ClusterArbitrationResult` with `effective_evictions` quorum gate (blocks eviction when >50% cluster agents evicted and `ConsensusEngine.has_quorum()` returns false); lineage digest per cluster epoch; allocation broadcast after each run. Authority invariant: writes only to local AgentBudgetPool; never approves mutations. 23 tests in `tests/test_cross_node_budget_arbitrator.py`.

: market × federation convergence:** `runtime/market/federated_signal_broker.py` — `FederatedSignalBroker` bridges `FeedRegistry` live composite readings into `GossipProtocol` broadcasts; `FederationMarketGossip` serialises `MarketSignalReading` ↔ `GossipEvent` (`market_signal_broadcast.v1`); `PeerReading` dataclass with freshness guard (60 s TTL, zero-confidence filter, stale-flag). `cluster_composite()` produces confidence-weighted aggregate across all alive nodes with graceful fallback to local reading on peer absence/failure. Authority invariant: broker never calls GovernanceGate. 24 tests in `tests/market/test_federated_signal_broker.py`.

### ADAAD-10 — Live Market Signal Adapters (v1.4)

- **PR-10-02 — MarketFitnessIntegrator + FitnessOrchestrator live wiring:** `runtime/market/market_fitness_integrator.py` — confidence-weighted composite from FeedRegistry injected into FitnessOrchestrator scoring context as `simulated_market_score`. Lineage digest + signal source propagated. Fail-closed: broken registry yields synthetic fallback. Journal event `market_fitness_signal_enriched.v1`. 12 tests in `tests/market/test_market_fitness_integrator.py` including end-to-end orchestrator integration.
- **PR-10-01 — FeedRegistry + concrete adapters + schema:** `runtime/market/feed_registry.py` — deterministic adapter ordering, TTL caching, fail-closed stale guard, confidence-weighted composite score. `runtime/market/adapters/live_adapters.py` — `VolatilityIndexAdapter` (inverted market stress), `ResourcePriceAdapter` (normalised compute cost), `DemandSignalAdapter` (DAU/WAU/retention composite). `schemas/market_signal_reading.v1.json` — validated signal reading schema. 19 tests in `tests/market/test_feed_registry.py`.

### ADAAD-9 — Developer Experience (v1.3)

- **PR-9-03 — Phase 5: Simulation Panel Integration (D3):** `ui/aponi/simulation_panel.js` delivers the inline simulation panel within the Aponi IDE proposal editor workflow. Wires `POST /simulation/run` and `GET /simulation/results/{run_id}` (Epic 2 / ADAAD-8 endpoints) with pre-populated constitution constraint defaults from `/simulation/context`. Surfaces comparative outcomes (actual vs simulated, delta per metric) and provenance (deterministic flag, replay seed) inline without navigation. `ui/aponi/index.html` gains section '04 · Inline Simulation' with `proposalSimulationPanel`, `simulationRun`, `simulationResults` IDs (required by `test_simulation_submission_and_inline_result_rendering`). Android epoch range limit honoured from context. Authority invariant maintained: panel authors simulation requests only; execution authority remains with GovernanceGate.
- **PR-9-02 — Phase 4: Replay Inspector e2e test extension (D5):** `tests/test_aponi_dashboard_e2e.py` extended with 4 new inspector tests: epoch chain coverage (last-N epochs in `proof_status`), canonical digest surfacing in replay diff, divergence alert visual distinction markers, and lineage navigation from a mutation to its full ancestor chain. All tests verify the existing `replay_inspector.js` + `/replay/diff` + `/replay/divergence` surface against the EPIC_3 D5 acceptance criteria.
- **PR-9-01 — Phase 3: Evidence Viewer (D4):** `ui/aponi/evidence_viewer.js` delivers a read-only, bearer-auth-gated evidence bundle inspector within the Aponi IDE. Fetches from `GET /evidence/{bundle_id}` and renders provenance fields (`bundle_id`, `constitution_version`, `scoring_algorithm_version`, `governor_version`, fitness/goal hashes), risk summaries (with high-risk highlighting), export metadata with signer fields, sandbox snapshot, and replay proof chain. `ui/aponi/index.html` gains section 03 · Evidence Viewer and wires `evidence_viewer.js` and `proposal_editor.js` as separate script modules. `tests/test_evidence_viewer.py` added: 17 tests covering schema conformance against `schemas/evidence_bundle.v1.json`, provenance field presence, auth gating, determinism, and high-risk flag propagation.

### ADAAD-8 — Policy Simulation Mode (v1.2)

- **PR-10 — DSL Grammar + Constraint Interpreter:** `runtime/governance/simulation/constraint_interpreter.py` delivers `SimulationPolicy` (frozen dataclass, `simulation=True` structurally enforced) and `interpret_policy_block()`. 10 constraint types: approval thresholds, risk ceilings, rate limits, complexity deltas, tier lockdowns, rule assertions, coverage floors, entropy caps, reviewer escalation, lineage depth requirements. `schemas/governance_simulation_policy.v1.json` schema-enforces `simulation: true`. 50 tests.
- **PR-11 — Epoch Replay Simulator + Isolation Invariant:** `runtime/governance/simulation/epoch_simulator.py` delivers `EpochReplaySimulator` as a read-only substrate over `ReplayEngine`. `SimulationPolicy.simulation=True` checked at `GovernanceGate` boundary before any evaluation. Zero ledger writes, zero constitution state transitions, zero mutation executor calls during simulation. `EpochSimulationResult` and `SimulationRunResult` are frozen dataclasses with deterministic `policy_digest` and `run_digest`. 38 tests including explicit isolation assertion tests.
- **PR-12 — Aponi Simulation Endpoints:** `POST /simulation/run` and `GET /simulation/results/{run_id}` added to `server.py`. Both bearer-auth gated (`audit:read` scope). `simulation: true` structurally present in all responses. `simulation_only_notice` always in `POST` response. 422 on DSL parse error. 11 tests.
- **PR-13 — Governance Profile Exporter (milestone):** `runtime/governance/simulation/profile_exporter.py` exports `SimulationRunResult` + `SimulationPolicy` as self-contained `GovernanceProfile` artifacts. `schemas/governance_profile.v1.json` schema-enforces `simulation: true` and `profile_digest` SHA-256 format. Determinism guarantee: identical inputs → identical `profile_digest`. `validate_profile_schema()` performs structural + optional JSON schema validation. 23 tests.

### CI / Governance

- **PR-DOCS-01 — C-03 docs closure:** `docs/governance/FEDERATION_KEY_REGISTRY.md` governance doc published. Documents registry architecture, key format, rotation policy, threat model, and operator runbook for adding/revoking keys. PR-OPS-01 prerequisite satisfied before publication. C-03 docs lane closed.
- **PR-OPS-01 — H-07/M-02 closure:** Snapshot atomicity and sequence ordering hardened. `runtime/governance/branch_manager.py` uses `_atomic_copy()` for all snapshot writes. `runtime/recovery/ledger_guardian.py` enforces sequence-ordered snapshot iteration with `snapshot_ordering_fallback_to_mtime` as the tie-break policy. H-07 and M-02 findings closed.
- **PR-PERF-01 — C-04 closure:** Streaming lineage ledger verify path implemented. Lineage verification now streams ledger entries incrementally rather than loading the full ledger into memory, reducing peak memory consumption for large lineage chains. `runtime/evolution/` verify paths updated. C-04 finding closed.
- **PR-SECURITY-01 — C-03 closure:** Federation key pinning registry implemented. `governance/federation_trusted_keys.json` is the governance-signed source of truth for all trusted federation public keys. `runtime/governance/federation/key_registry.py` loads and caches the registry at process boot. `runtime/governance/federation/transport.py` `verify_message_signature()` now calls `get_trusted_public_key(key_id)` — caller-supplied key substitution attacks are closed. `FederationTransportContractError` raised for any unregistered `key_id`. C-03 finding closed. `docs/governance/FEDERATION_KEY_REGISTRY.md` governance doc published.
- **PR-HARDEN-01 — C-01/H-02 closure:** Boot env validation and signing key assertion hardened in `app/main.py` and `security/cryovant.py`. `ADAAD_GOVERNANCE_SESSION_SIGNING_KEY` presence is asserted at orchestrator boot in strict environments (`staging`, `production`, `prod`) with fail-closed `CRITICAL` log emission. `BootPreflightService.validate_cryovant()` wires `security.cryovant.validate_environment()` as a typed `StatusEnvelope` gate. C-01 and H-02 findings closed.
- **PR-LINT-01 — H-05 closure:** Determinism lint extended to `adaad/orchestrator/` (dispatcher, registry, bootstrap). `tools/lint_determinism.py` `TARGET_DIRS` and `ENTROPY_ENFORCED_PREFIXES` now include `adaad/orchestrator/`; `REQUIRED_GOVERNANCE_FILES` declares the four orchestrator modules. `determinism-lint` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` scans `adaad/orchestrator/` on every push/PR. `determinism_lint.yml` standalone workflow triggers on orchestrator path changes. H-05 finding closed.
- **PR-CI-01 — H-01 closure:** Unified Python version pin at `3.11.9` across all
  `.github/workflows/*.yml` files. `scripts/check_workflow_python_version.py` enforces
  the pin and is wired as a fail-closed CI guard. GA-1.1..GA-1.6 and GA-KR.1 controls
  confirmed complete in `docs/governance/ADAAD_7_GA_CLOSURE_TRACKER.md`.
- **PR-CI-02 — H-08 closure:** SPDX license header enforcement wired always-on as
  `spdx-header-lint` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. `scripts/check_spdx_headers.py`
  confirms all Python source files carry `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`.
  Fixed missing header in `tests/test_branch_protection_policy_workflow.py`.
  `docs/GOVERNANCE_ENFORCEMENT.md` required checks table updated. Claims evidence matrix
  `spdx-header-compliance` row marked Complete.

### Fixed
- Mutation fitness simulation now uses a deterministic structural DNA clone with `deepcopy` fallback, bounded LRU stable-hash score caching, agent-scoped cache keys within a shared bounded LRU cache, tuple-marker hash hardening, and a fail-closed simulation budget guard (resolved once at orchestrator boot); simulation fails closed when required DNA lineage is missing.
- Governance certifier now binds `token_ok` in pass/fail decisions and emits explicit `forbidden_token_detected` violations when token scan checks fail.
- Governance-critical auth call sites (`GateCertifier`, `ArchitectGovernor`) now use `verify_governance_token(...)` instead of deprecated `verify_session(...)`.
- Recovery tier auto-application now enforces explicit escalation/de-escalation semantics with recovery-window-gated de-escalation.

### Security
- Payload-bound legacy static signatures (`cryovant-static-*`) are now accepted only in explicit dev mode (`ADAAD_ENV=dev` + `CRYOVANT_DEV_MODE`) and rejected in non-dev mode with audit telemetry.
- Added deterministic production governance token contract (`cryovant-gov-v1`) via `sign_governance_token(...)` and `verify_governance_token(...)`.
- Governance token signer/verifier now rejects `key_id`/`nonce` delimiter ambiguity (`:`) for fail-closed token-structure validation.
- Deterministic-provider enforcement now covers governance-critical recovery tiers (`governance`, `critical`) while retaining `audit` alias compatibility.

### Added
- MCP schemas for proposal request/response and mutation analysis response under `schemas/mcp/`.

### ADAAD-9 Foundation
- Editor submission telemetry now emits `aponi_editor_proposal_submitted.v1` only for explicit Aponi editor request context headers, with actor/session metadata and no proposal body leakage.
- Aponi dashboard now serves replay inspector assets (`/ui/aponi/replay_inspector.js`) and exposes deterministic replay lineage drill-down metadata in `/replay/diff` responses (`lineage_chain`).
- Added governed simulation passthrough endpoints in standalone Aponi mode: `GET /simulation/context`, `POST /simulation/run`, and `GET /simulation/results/{run_id}` with constitution provenance and bounded epoch-range guardrails.
- Added deterministic `MutationLintingBridge` for editor preflight annotations and authenticated read-only evidence endpoint `GET /evidence/{bundle_id}` for Aponi evidence viewers.
- Added Aponi proposal-editor lint preview endpoint `GET /api/lint/preview` and explicit editor proposal journal event emission (`aponi_editor_proposal_submitted.v1`) on editor-origin submissions.
- MCP test coverage for tools parity, proposal validation, mutation analysis, rejection explanation, candidate ranking, and server route/auth contracts.

### Fixed

### Changed
- Documented MCP architecture, route map, and server→tool mapping in `docs/mcp/IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

### Added
- Claude-governed MCP co-pilot integration (feat/claude-mcp-copilot).

  .github/mcp_config.json: GitHub Copilot-compatible server configuration.

### Fixed
- CRITICAL: verify_signature() in security/cryovant.py now performs real
  HMAC-SHA-256 verification. Stub that always returned False removed.
- BLOCKING: --serve-mcp CLI flag now exists in ui/aponi_dashboard.py.

### Changed
- docs/CONSTITUTION.md: added LLM Proposal Agent governance clause.
- runtime/autonomy/roles.py: registered ClaudeProposalAgent.

### Changed
- Cryovant agent certificate checks now prefer payload-bound HMAC verification with legacy static/dev fallback telemetry during migration.

- Added shared-epoch strict replay stress coverage across repeated parallel runs to validate digest/order stability.
- Fixed a circular import between constitutional policy loading and metrics analysis by lazily importing lineage replay dependencies during determinism scoring.
- Metrics analysis lineage-ledger factory now supports explicit or `ADAAD_LINEAGE_PATH` path resolution, validates `LEDGER_V2_PATH` fallback, and creates parent directories before ledger initialization.
- Journal tail-state recovery now records deterministic warning metrics events when cached tail hashes require full-chain rescans.
- UX tools now include real-time CLI stage parsing, optional global error excepthook installer, expanded onboarding validation checks, and WebSocket-first enhanced dashboard updates with polling fallback.

- Added regression coverage for mixed lexical-vs-resolved agent path forms in `tests/test_evolution_kernel.py`.
- Aponi execution-control now validates queue targets by command id, returning explicit `target_not_found` or `target_not_executable` errors before orchestration.

### Added
- Constitutional enforcement semantics now consistently apply enabled-rule gating with applicability pass-through (`rule_not_applicable`) and tier override resolution, improving deterministic verdict replay behavior.
- Replay/determinism posture updated for constitutional evaluation, increasing deterministic evidence surface while preserving reproducible policy-hash/version coupling across audits.
- Added read-only Aponi replay forensics endpoints (`/replay/divergence`, `/replay/diff?epoch_id=...`) and versioned governance health model metadata (`v1.0.0`).
- Added Aponi V2 governance docs: replay forensics + health model, red-team pressure scenario, and 0.70.0 draft release notes.
- Added epoch entropy observability helper (`runtime/evolution/telemetry_audit.py`) for declared vs observed entropy breakdown by epoch.

### Security
- Enabled blocking constitutional checks for `lineage_continuity` and `resource_bounds`, strengthening mutation safety controls while retaining policy-defined tier behavior.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-03-06

### Phase 3 — Adaptive Penalty Weights (SHIPPED)

#### PR-PHASE3-01: PenaltyAdaptor
- **New:** `runtime/autonomy/penalty_adaptor.py` — momentum-descent learner for `risk_penalty` and `complexity_penalty`
- Activation gate: `MIN_EPOCHS_FOR_PENALTY=5` (pass-through below threshold)
- Signal derivation: post-merge `actually_risky`/`actually_complex` flags (quality-1); heuristic `risk_score > 0.50` (fallback)
- EMA smoothing (alpha=0.25), momentum=0.80, learning_rate=0.04
- All weights bounded `[0.05, 0.70]` — constitutional invariant enforced
- `WeightAdaptor` wired: penalty state path derived from adaptor path (test-safe)
- Pre-existing test bug fixed: `acceptance_threshold` default corrected 0.25→0.24
- **Tests: 17 PenaltyAdaptor + 1 integration = 18 new tests passing**

#### PR-PHASE3-02: Thompson Sampling + Non-Stationarity Detector
- **New:** `runtime/autonomy/non_stationarity_detector.py` — Page-Hinkley sequential change detection
- PH constants: threshold=0.20, delta=0.02, MIN_OBSERVATIONS=5, cooldown=3 epochs
- EMA warm-start: `running_mean` initialised to first observation (prevents false-positive accumulation)
- `FitnessLandscape` wired: live UCB1 win rates fed into detector after every `record()`
- Escalation order: plateau→dream, thompson_active→ThompsonBanditSelector, UCB1→BanditSelector, v1 fallback
- Thompson rng seeded from hash(sorted arm state) — deterministic, no external entropy
- `_thompson_active` flag persisted in landscape state JSON (survives restarts)
- **Tests: 15 detector + 8 integration = 23 new tests passing**

### Phase 4 — Semantic Mutation Diff Engine (IN PROGRESS)

#### PR-PHASE4-01: SemanticDiffEngine
- **New:** `runtime/evolution/semantic_diff.py` — AST-based risk and complexity scoring (332 lines)
- `ASTMetrics.from_source()`: node_count, max_depth, cyclomatic complexity, import_count, function_count, class_count, max_nesting
- Risk formula: `(ast_depth_delta × 0.3) + (cyclomatic_delta × 0.4) + (import_surface_delta × 0.3)`
- Complexity formula: `(node_count_norm × 0.5) + (nesting_depth_norm × 0.5)`
- Normalization caps: MAX_AST_DEPTH=50, MAX_CYCLOMATIC=30, MAX_IMPORTS=20, MAX_NODES=500, MAX_NESTING=15
- Graceful fallback on None input or SyntaxError → 0.5/0.5 (no scoring regression)
- `enrich_code_diff_with_semantic()`: backward-compatible dict enrichment with semantic scores
- Algorithm version: `semantic_diff_v1.0` (baked in for replay verification)
- Zero new dependencies — uses Python stdlib `ast` module only
- **Tests: 22 new tests passing**

### ADAAD-10 Track A — Live Market Signal Adapters

- **PR-10-02 — POST /market/signal webhook endpoint + integration tests:** `server.py` gains `POST /market/signal` bearer-auth-gated endpoint routing raw payloads through `LiveSignalRouter` → lineage-stamped `MarketSignalReading` → fitness advisory injection; journal event `market_signal_ingested.v1`. `tests/test_market_fitness_integrator.py`: 11 tests covering integrator bridging (live, synthetic fallback, lineage propagation, journal), `FitnessOrchestrator.inject_live_signal()` override (score override, no-override passthrough, clamping, bad epoch silent drop). ADAAD-10 Track A complete.

- **PR-10-01 — MarketFitnessIntegrator + FitnessOrchestrator live signal injection:** `runtime/market/market_fitness_integrator.py` bridges `FeedRegistry.composite_reading()` into `FitnessOrchestrator.inject_live_signal()` replacing the static `simulated_market_score` with confidence-weighted live readings; synthetic fallback (0.5, zero confidence) on source failure. `runtime/evolution/fitness_orchestrator.py`: `inject_live_signal()` method + `_apply_live_override()` wired into `score()` pre-snapshot. `runtime/market/__init__.py` updated. Authority invariant: GovernanceGate retains final mutation-approval authority; market scores are fitness inputs only.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-05 · ADAAD-10 Live Market Signal Adapters

Live economic signals replace synthetic constants across the entire fitness pipeline.

**FeedRegistry** (`runtime/market/feed_registry.py`): deterministic adapter ordering, TTL caching, fail-closed stale guard, confidence-weighted composite. Three concrete adapters: `VolatilityIndexAdapter` (inverted market stress), `ResourcePriceAdapter` (normalised compute cost), `DemandSignalAdapter` (DAU/WAU/retention composite).

**MarketFitnessIntegrator** (`runtime/market/market_fitness_integrator.py`): bridges FeedRegistry composite into `FitnessOrchestrator.score()` as live `simulated_market_score`. Lineage digest + signal source propagated. Journal event `market_fitness_signal_enriched.v1`.

**Schema**: `schemas/market_signal_reading.v1.json` — validated signal reading contract.

Authority invariant: adapters are read-only; they influence fitness scoring but cannot approve mutations.


### ADAAD-11 Track B — Darwinian Agent Budget Competition

- **PR-11-02 — DarwinianSelectionPipeline + tests (ADAAD-11 complete):** `runtime/evolution/budget/darwinian_pipeline.py` post-fitness hook couples `FitnessOrchestrator` scores to `BudgetArbitrator` completing the Darwinian selection loop; `darwinian_selection_complete.v1` journal event. `tests/test_darwinian_budget.py`: 16 tests — AgentBudgetPool (invariants, reallocation, eviction, ledger), BudgetArbitrator (Softmax, starvation, market scalar), CompetitionLedger (append-only, persist, audit export), FitnessOrchestrator post-fitness wire. ADAAD-11 Track B complete.
- **PR-11-01 — AgentBudgetPool + BudgetArbitrator + CompetitionLedger:** `runtime/evolution/budget/` package: `pool.py` (finite pool, append-only allocation ledger, starvation detection, eviction), `arbitrator.py` (Softmax fitness-weighted reallocation, market pressure scalar, starvation accumulation, eviction at threshold), `competition_ledger.py` (append-only JSONL-backed event log, eviction history, audit export, sha256 lineage digests). Authority invariant: arbitrator writes to pool only; never approves or signs mutations.

### ADAAD-12 Track C — Real Container-Level Isolation Backend

- **PR-12-02 — executor.py orchestrator wiring + lifecycle audit trail + tests:** `tests/test_container_orchestrator.py`: 20 tests covering ContainerPool (bounded pool, acquire/release/quarantine), ContainerOrchestrator (allocate, mark_running, release, health checks, journal events, pool_status), ContainerHealthProbe (liveness/readiness, quarantine detection, empty container_id), lifecycle FSM (IDLE→PREPARING→RUNNING→IDLE/QUARANTINE, lineage digest on transition). ADAAD_SANDBOX_CONTAINER_ROLLOUT=true activates ContainerOrchestrator as default. ADAAD-12 Track C complete.
- **PR-12-01 — ContainerOrchestrator + ContainerHealthProbe + default profiles:** `runtime/sandbox/container_orchestrator.py`: `ContainerOrchestrator` (pool management, lifecycle state machine IDLE→PREPARING→RUNNING→DONE/FAILED/QUARANTINE, journal events for allocation/release/health), `ContainerPool` (bounded slot ceiling, acquire/release, quarantine), `ContainerSlot` (sha256 lineage digest per transition). `runtime/sandbox/container_health.py`: `ContainerHealthProbe` (liveness + readiness checks, graceful degradation in CI). `runtime/sandbox/container_profiles/`: `default_seccomp.json` (syscall allowlist), `default_network.json` (deny-all egress), `default_resources.json` (cgroup v2 quotas: 50% CPU, 256MB RAM, 64 PIDs). Authority invariant: container backend does not expand mutation authority.

### ADAAD-13 Track D — Fully Autonomous Multi-Node Federation

- **PR-13-02 — Federation integration tests + split-brain resolution (ADAAD-13 complete):** `tests/test_federation_autonomous.py`: 26 tests — PeerRegistry (registration, heartbeat, stale/alive TTL detection, partition threshold, deregister, idempotent re-registration), GossipProtocol (valid/malformed event handling, queue drain, digest format), FederationConsensusEngine (initial follower, election→candidate→leader, majority vote, log append leader-only, commit_entry, quorum gate for policy_change, heartbeat reset, vote grant/deny), FederationNodeSupervisor (healthy/partitioned tick, safe_mode_active, partition journal event). ADAAD-13 Track D complete.
- **PR-13-01 — PeerRegistry + GossipProtocol + FederationConsensusEngine + FederationNodeSupervisor:** `runtime/governance/federation/peer_discovery.py`: `PeerRegistry` (TTL-based liveness, stale/alive partition detection, idempotent registration, heartbeat update, partition threshold check), `GossipProtocol` (HTTP broadcast to alive peers, inbound event validation + queue, sha256 lineage digest per event, best-effort non-blocking). `runtime/governance/federation/consensus.py`: `FederationConsensusEngine` (Raft-inspired — leader election with term-based majority vote, append-only log with lineage digests, constitutional quorum gate for policy changes, heartbeat/rejoin). `runtime/governance/federation/node_supervisor.py`: `FederationNodeSupervisor` (heartbeat tick, partition detection → safe mode, autonomous rejoin broadcast, degraded state tracking). Authority invariant: consensus provides ordering only; GovernanceGate retains execution authority.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-03-05 · ADAAD-14 Cross-Track Convergence

All four ADAAD-10–13 runtime tracks converge into a unified, production-grade autonomous governance stack.

### ADAAD-14 · Cross-Track Convergence — What shipped

**PR-14-01 · FederatedSignalBroker (market × federation)**
`runtime/market/federated_signal_broker.py` — `FederatedSignalBroker` publishes local `FeedRegistry` composite readings to all alive federation peers via `GossipProtocol` (`market_signal_broadcast.v1`); ingests peer readings with 60 s TTL freshness guard; `cluster_composite()` produces confidence-weighted aggregate across all nodes; graceful fallback to local reading on peer absence or feed failure. 24 tests.

**PR-14-02 · CrossNodeBudgetArbitrator (Darwinian × federation)**
`runtime/evolution/budget/cross_node_arbitrator.py` — `CrossNodeBudgetArbitrator` gossips local agent fitness scores to peers (`budget_fitness_broadcast.v1`), merges cluster-wide scores (local authoritative on conflict), runs Softmax reallocation across the cluster, broadcasts allocation decisions (`budget_allocation_broadcast.v1`). Quorum gate: evictions affecting >50% of cluster agents require `ConsensusEngine.has_quorum()` before applying (fail-open in single-node mode). 23 tests.

**PR-14-03 · MarketDrivenContainerProfiler (market × container)**
`runtime/sandbox/market_driven_profiler.py` — `MarketDrivenContainerProfiler` queries `FeedRegistry` or `FederatedSignalBroker` cluster composite to select cgroup v2 resource tier: CONSTRAINED (cpu=25%, mem=128 MB) below score 0.35; BURST (cpu=80%, mem=512 MB) at or above 0.65; STANDARD otherwise. Confidence guard (below 0.30 → STANDARD forced). Two new container profiles added: `market_constrained.json` + `market_burst.json`. 22 tests.

### Authority invariants upheld
- `FederatedSignalBroker` is advisory only — market readings influence fitness but never approve mutations.
- `CrossNodeBudgetArbitrator` writes to local `AgentBudgetPool` only — consensus provides ordering, never execution authority.
- `MarketDrivenContainerProfiler` is advisory — `ContainerOrchestrator` retains pool and lifecycle authority.
- `GovernanceGate` remains the sole mutation approval authority across all convergence surfaces.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-03-05 · ADAAD-13 Autonomous Multi-Node Federation

### ADAAD-10 · Live Market Signal Adapters
FeedRegistry + VolatilityIndex/ResourcePrice/DemandSignal adapters + MarketSignalReading schema + MarketFitnessIntegrator + FitnessOrchestrator.inject_live_signal() + POST /market/signal webhook. Live DAU/retention signals replace synthetic constants activating real Darwinian selection pressure.

### ADAAD-11 · Darwinian Agent Budget Competition
AgentBudgetPool + BudgetArbitrator (Softmax, market pressure scalar, starvation/eviction) + CompetitionLedger (append-only, sha256 lineage) + DarwinianSelectionPipeline (post-fitness hook). High-fitness agents earn allocation; low-fitness agents starve and are evicted.

### ADAAD-12 · Real Container-Level Isolation Backend
ContainerOrchestrator (pool lifecycle FSM, health probes, journal events) + ContainerHealthProbe + 3 default profiles (seccomp/network/resources). ADAAD_SANDBOX_CONTAINER_ROLLOUT=true activates kernel-enforced cgroup v2 limits.

### ADAAD-13 · Fully Autonomous Multi-Node Federation
PeerRegistry (TTL liveness, partition detection) + GossipProtocol (HTTP broadcast, inbound queue, sha256 lineage) + FederationConsensusEngine (Raft-inspired — term election, log replication, constitutional quorum gate) + FederationNodeSupervisor (heartbeat, safe mode, autonomous rejoin). Federation moves from file-based to autonomous peer discovery, quorum consensus, and cross-node constitutional enforcement.

**Authority invariants maintained throughout all four milestones:**
- Market adapters influence fitness only; GovernanceGate retains mutation authority.
- Budget arbitration reallocates pool shares; never approves mutations.
- Container backend hardens execution surface; does not expand mutation authority.
- Consensus provides ordering; GovernanceGate retains execution authority for cross-node policy changes.


## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-05 · ADAAD-9 Developer Experience

### ADAAD-9 · Aponi-as-IDE — Governance-First Developer Environment

Aponi evolves from a read-only governance observatory into a **governance-first authoring environment**. Developers can now author, lint, simulate, and inspect evidence for mutation proposals entirely within a single browser-accessible interface — without departing to a second toolchain.

**D1 — Mutation Proposal Editor:** `ui/aponi/proposal_editor.js` routes proposals through `POST /mutation/propose`; emits `aponi_editor_proposal_submitted.v1` journal event on every editor-originated submission.

**D2 — Inline Constitutional Linter:** `runtime/mcp/linting_bridge.py` (`MutationLintingBridge`) wraps `mutation_analyzer.py`; debounced 800ms; uses same rule engine as `GovernanceGate`; `AndroidMonitor.should_throttle()` governs call frequency; determinism tests in `tests/mcp/test_linting_bridge.py`.

**D3 — Simulation Panel:** `ui/aponi/simulation_panel.js`; wires Epic 2 `POST /simulation/run` + `GET /simulation/results/{run_id}`; pre-populates constraints from `/simulation/context`; surfaces comparative outcomes (actual/simulated/delta) and provenance (deterministic, replay_seed) inline.

**D4 — Evidence Viewer:** `ui/aponi/evidence_viewer.js`; fetches `GET /evidence/{bundle_id}`; renders provenance fields (`constitution_version`, `scoring_algorithm_version`, `governor_version`, hashes), risk summaries with high-risk highlight, signer fields, sandbox snapshot, replay proof chain. 17 tests in `tests/test_evidence_viewer.py` covering schema conformance, auth gating, provenance presence, determinism.

**D5 — Replay Inspector:** `ui/aponi/replay_inspector.js` over `/replay/divergence` + `/replay/diff`; navigable epoch-by-epoch transition chain; divergence alert distinction; lineage navigation from mutation to full ancestor chain. 4 new e2e tests in `tests/test_aponi_dashboard_e2e.py`.

**D6 — Android/Pydroid3 Compatibility:** All heavy operations (simulation, evidence fetch) respect `AndroidMonitor.should_throttle()`; epoch range bounded by platform limit from `/simulation/context`.

**Authority invariant:** Aponi IDE introduces no new execution path. All write operations route through `POST /mutation/propose` → MCP queue → `GovernanceGate` → constitutional evaluation → staging. `authority_level` clamped to `governor-review` by `proposal_validator.py` for all editor-originated submissions.
