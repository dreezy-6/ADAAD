## Discord / Slack — Developer Communities

### AI/ML servers (e.g. Eleuther, HuggingFace, MLOps Community)

**Channel: #projects / #show-your-work**

> Hey everyone — sharing something I've been working on that might be interesting here.
>
> ADAAD is an open-source framework for governed autonomous code evolution. The short version: AI agents propose code improvements, they compete in a genetic-algorithm tournament, and the survivors face a constitutional policy gate before anything changes.
>
> The piece I find most interesting from an ML systems perspective: the gate is entirely deterministic. No LLM is asked "is this safe?" — the 16 rules are computational checks (AST validity, banned token scan, crypto signature, resource bounds, etc.). Any governance decision can be replayed from logged inputs and produces byte-identical results. Divergence halts the pipeline.
>
> Phase 6 is the wild one: the system can now propose amendments to its own roadmap. Same gate. Human sign-off required. `authority_level = "governor-review"` is hardcoded and injection-blocked.
>
> Free, open source: https://github.com/InnovativeAI-adaad/ADAAD
> Happy to answer questions about the governance architecture.

### DevOps / Platform Engineering servers

**Channel: #tools / #cicd**

> Dropping this here because it's relevant to anyone thinking about AI-assisted CI/CD at scale.
>
> ADAAD runs a continuous improvement loop on a codebase — AI proposes, constitutional gate decides, evidence ledger records everything. The audit trail is the interesting part: it's hash-chained (SHA-256, append-only), every decision is deterministically replayable, and a release evidence matrix maps every claim to a specific in-repo artifact before anything ships.
>
> For teams where "who changed what and why" is a real compliance requirement, the replay model is worth a look.

### Open Source communities

**Channel: #new-projects**

> Sharing ADAAD — an open-source AI code evolution engine with constitutional governance.
>
> Three AI agents compete to improve your codebase each epoch. Best proposals pass through a 16-rule policy gate. Everything is logged, hash-chained, and deterministically replayable. Free Android dashboard app included.
>
> What's unusual: the governance layer is architecturally non-bypassable, not just documented policy. `GovernanceGate` is literally the only component that can approve a mutation.

## Newsletter Pitches

### TLDR Newsletter (developer audience, ~1M subscribers)

**Pitch:**

Hi TLDR team,

Pitching a project for the Open Source or AI section:

**ADAAD** — open-source AI code evolution with constitutional gating
https://github.com/InnovativeAI-adaad/ADAAD

The angle: most AI coding tools ask humans to approve every suggestion. ADAAD is designed for autonomous/semi-autonomous operation — which means the governance constraints have to be architectural, not advisory. Three Claude-powered agents compete to propose improvements, a genetic algorithm scores them, and the survivors face a 16-rule policy engine. One blocking failure = full halt. The gate is the only approval surface in the system.

The technically interesting part: every governance decision is deterministically replayable from logged inputs. Replay divergence = immediate halt. This is what makes it auditable rather than just logged.

Current version: 3.1.0-dev, Phase 6 active (system can now propose changes to its own roadmap, still requires human sign-off). Free Android app. MIT license.

Happy to provide more technical detail or a demo.

### Pointer.io (curated links for developers)

> **ADAAD** — AI agents that evolve your codebase under constitutional governance. Three Claude-powered agents propose, genetic algorithm scores, 16-rule policy gate decides. One failure halts everything. Every decision is deterministically replayable. Phase 6: it now proposes amendments to its own roadmap (human sign-off required). Free, open source, free Android app.

### Console.dev (open source tools newsletter)

**Submission:**

**Tool:** ADAAD
**Category:** AI Development / DevOps
**License:** MIT
**Link:** https://github.com/InnovativeAI-adaad/ADAAD

**What it does:** Runs a continuous AI-assisted code improvement loop with constitutional governance. Three AI agents propose mutations, a genetic algorithm tournament scores and selects them, and survivors face a 16-rule policy engine before any change is applied.

**What's interesting:** The governance layer is architecturally enforced — `GovernanceGate` is the only code path with mutation approval authority. Every decision is deterministically replayable from logged inputs. A hash-chained evidence ledger records every governed action. Phase 6 (current): the system can propose amendments to its own roadmap, subject to the same gate and mandatory human sign-off.

**For whom:** Teams wanting AI-assisted continuous improvement without the liability of unsupervised changes; organizations needing real audit trails; developers building safe AI-assisted systems.

**Android:** Free dashboard app, no Play Store required.

### Target repos: governance-focused AI tools, autonomous coding agents, MLOps frameworks

**Template message:**

> Hi — I've been following [PROJECT] and wanted to share a related open-source project that might be interesting to your community or useful as a reference for [GOVERNANCE/SAFETY/AUDIT] patterns.
>
> ADAAD (https://github.com/InnovativeAI-adaad/ADAAD) is a governed autonomous code evolution engine. The governance layer is the interesting part: a 16-rule constitutional gate is the only approval surface in the system, every decision is deterministically replayable, and a hash-chained ledger records everything. We've been running it on itself — ADAAD evolves ADAAD through its own governed pipeline.
>
> Phase 6 is currently active: the system can propose amendments to its own development roadmap, still gated by the constitution and requiring human governor sign-off.
>
> Not trying to compete — just thought the constitutional governance model and determinism-first approach might be useful context for your project or community. Happy to discuss any of it.
