# Codex Setup for ADAAD Governed Build Agent

This runbook provides the discovery path and installation checklist for enabling
Codex with the ADAAD governed build-agent contract.

## Alignment objective

Codex setup is considered aligned only when the following stay synchronized:

1. Trigger/authorization contract in `AGENTS.md`.
2. Governance authority hierarchy and gate taxonomy used by active build sessions.
3. Evidence production expectations in `docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md`.
4. Session-state lifecycle requirements for `.adaad_agent_state.json`.

## Source-of-truth files

- Agent contract: `AGENTS.md` (repository root).
- Strategic build model: `docs/ADAAD_STRATEGIC_BUILD_SUGGESTIONS.md`.
- Lane ownership register: `docs/governance/LANE_OWNERSHIP.md`.
- CI tier classifier: `docs/governance/ci-gating.md`.

## System prompt location policy

The full Codex system prompt content may be maintained outside this repository
(for example in a Codex admin console or private operator runbook).

When prompt text is maintained outside git, this file is the required discovery
entry point and must document:

1. where the authoritative prompt is stored,
2. who can update it,
3. when it was last synchronized with `AGENTS.md`.

## Installation checklist (v1.1 alignment)

- [ ] `AGENTS.md` is present at repository root and matches v1.1.0 contract semantics.
- [ ] Codex has read access to the full ADAAD repository tree.
- [ ] `.adaad_agent_state.json` is ignored via `.gitignore`.
- [ ] `python scripts/validate_adaad_agent_state.py` passes before session actions.
- [ ] `.adaad_agent_state.json` is registered in `docs/DIAGRAM_OWNERSHIP.md` (owner: build-agent).
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` references `AGENTS.md` for governed build contributions.
- [ ] `.adaad_operator_contacts.json` (if used) is local-only and never committed.
- [ ] `docs/governance/LANE_OWNERSHIP.md` has current lane owners.
- [ ] First invocation test executed with `ADAAD status`.
- [ ] Second invocation test executed with `ADAAD preflight`.
- [ ] Third invocation test executed with `ADAAD`.

## Ongoing synchronization checklist

Run this checklist whenever `AGENTS.md` workflow semantics change.

- [ ] This runbook reflects trigger variants (`status`, `preflight`, `verify`, `audit`, `retry`).
- [ ] Tier 0/1/2/3 gate definitions remain consistent with `AGENTS.md`.
- [ ] `docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md` includes or updates a claim row for agent/governance-operability assertions.
- [ ] Required scripts/commands are documented with deterministic invocation examples.
- [ ] Session-start guard `python scripts/validate_adaad_agent_state.py` is included in local preflight.
- [ ] Canonical-path guidance remains consistent with `docs/ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md`.

## Architecture snapshot drift remediation (builder workflow)

If Tier 0 preflight fails at `python scripts/validate_architecture_snapshot.py`
with `architecture snapshot metadata drift detected`, treat it as a **build-state
alignment issue** (not product behavior drift).

Required remediation sequence:

1. Refresh metadata in-place:

   ```bash
   python scripts/validate_architecture_snapshot.py --write
   ```

2. Stage the regenerated `docs/README_IMPLEMENTATION_ALIGNMENT.md` change in the
   same commit window **only when the script rewrites the file**.
3. Re-run Tier 0 preflight to confirm the repository is clean before any
   implementation file is touched.

Prevent recurrence by keeping the metadata block structure intact and re-running
`--write` only when report-version or metadata schema expectations change.

## Operator note

Changes to trigger contracts, gate order, workflow semantics, or tier taxonomy in
`AGENTS.md` should be followed by a Codex prompt synchronization check in the
same change window.


## Environment bootstrap (recommended before ADAAD preflight)

Preferred setup path (governed, end-to-end):

```bash
python onboard.py
```

Fallback (use only when `onboard.py` cannot run in your environment):

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.server.txt
python - <<'PY'
import importlib.util
assert importlib.util.find_spec("yaml") is not None, "PyYAML missing"
assert importlib.util.find_spec("nacl") is not None, "PyNaCl missing"
print("dependency bootstrap ok: yaml + nacl present")
PY
```

Then run Tier-0 preflight commands exactly as specified in `AGENTS.md`.

## Tier 0 remediation helper policy

Use `python scripts/tier0_remediation.py` to run Tier 0 gate verification and print deterministic next steps.

- The helper intentionally does **not** run `git checkout -b`, `git push`, or `gh pr create`.
- VCS network operations belong in a separate wrapper script.
- Optional local-only commit mode is available via `--local-commit` (no network).
- The helper always prints a deterministic commit message template for operator use.
