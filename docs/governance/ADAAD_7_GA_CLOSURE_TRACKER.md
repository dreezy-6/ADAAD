## ADAAD v1.1-GA Closure Tracker (Historical Baseline)

This document preserves the completed ADAAD-7 / v1.1-GA closure controls as a historical audit baseline.

> Current sequencing and roadmap execution are tracked in [`ADAAD_PR_PROCESSION_2026-03.md`](./ADAAD_PR_PROCESSION_2026-03.md) and [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md).

> Use this file for historical evidence traceability only; do not treat it as the active forward plan.

## Historical Phase 1 Control Gate (completed)

| Control ID | Requirement | Acceptance criteria | Evidence artifact(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GA-1.1 | Auth contract enforcement merged and verified | `GateCertifier.passed` path is token-backed (`token_ok`) and CI is green on release SHA | [`runtime/governance/gate_certifier.py`](../../runtime/governance/gate_certifier.py); [`tests/governance/test_certifier_security_scan.py`](../../tests/governance/test_certifier_security_scan.py) | ✅ |
| GA-1.2 | `verify_session()` call-site audit complete | No runtime/app usage outside approved test-only contexts | [`security/cryovant.py`](../../security/cryovant.py); [`tests/`](../../tests/) | ✅ |
| GA-1.3 | CI hardening merged | `secret_scan.yml` exists and branch protection blocks on secret scan | [`secret_scan.yml`](../../.github/workflows/secret_scan.yml); [`branch_protection_check.yml`](../../.github/workflows/branch_protection_check.yml) | ✅ |
| GA-1.4 | Evidence matrix aligned to strict gate | Every strict gate claim maps to test + artifact path + owner | [`docs/comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md`](../comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md) | ✅ |
| GA-1.5 | Deterministic governance gate refactor complete | Gate decisions are pure/replay-safe; nondeterministic sources removed | [`runtime/governance/gate_certifier.py`](../../runtime/governance/gate_certifier.py); [`tests/determinism/`](../../tests/determinism/) | ✅ |
| GA-1.6 | Mutation risk scorer suite expanded | 25+ deterministic cases passing in hermetic and CI environments | [`tests/governance/test_mutation_risk_scorer.py`](../../tests/governance/test_mutation_risk_scorer.py) | ✅ |

## Supporting controls promoted from watch-items

| Control ID | Requirement | Acceptance criteria | Evidence artifact(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GA-KR.1 | Key rotation enforcement audit | Rotation freshness policy and escalation are evidenced in release package | [`docs/governance/FEDERATION_KEY_REGISTRY.md`](./FEDERATION_KEY_REGISTRY.md); [`scripts/validate_key_rotation_attestation.py`](../../scripts/validate_key_rotation_attestation.py) | ✅ |
| GA-RP.1 | Replay-proof trust-root hardening scope | Third-party verifier trust-root plan is documented and approved | [`STRICT_REPLAY_INVARIANTS.md`](./STRICT_REPLAY_INVARIANTS.md); [`ARCHITECT_SPEC_v2.0.0.md` §3.3](./ARCHITECT_SPEC_v2.0.0.md) | ✅ |
| GA-SB.1 | Sandbox timeout and backend fail-closed parity | Mutation execution fails closed deterministically across backends | [`resource_bounds.py`](../../runtime/governance/validators/resource_bounds.py); [`test_resource_bounds.py`](../../tests/test_resource_bounds.py); [`claims_evidence_matrix.md`](../comms/claims_evidence_matrix.md) | ✅ |

## Sign-off protocol

- Governance Lead signs only when all `GA-1.x` controls are complete.
- Security Lead signs when `GA-1.1`, `GA-1.2`, `GA-1.3`, and `GA-KR.1` are complete.
- Runtime/Codex sign-off required for `GA-1.5`, `GA-1.6`, and `GA-SB.1`.
- Historical note: release tag `v1.1-GA` was blocked until all mandatory controls were checked.

## Evidence packaging notes

- Prefer immutable artifact pointers (commit SHA + CI run ID + signed report hash).
- For replay evidence, include digest outputs from strict mode and bundle verifier output.
- For checklist portability, mirror final evidence links in release notes and audit memo.
