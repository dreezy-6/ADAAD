## Documentation validators

Both validators run as fail-closed CI checks:

```bash
python scripts/validate_readme_alignment.py --format json
python scripts/validate_docs_integrity.py --format json
```

- `validate_readme_alignment.py` — enforces contract snippets across key README and release files.
- `validate_docs_integrity.py` — scans all `.md` files, validates local links and image targets, flags missing alt text.

---

## Orchestration hardening invariants

`app/orchestration/mutation_orchestration_service.py` enforces:

- Task normalization is deterministic (first-seen order, deduplicated labels).
- Empty/whitespace-only task batches resolve to `safe_boot=True`.
- Malformed/non-string task records are ignored without raising side effects.
- Transition failures preserve fail-closed behavior (`run_cycle=False`).
- Blocked transition payloads are isolated per envelope to prevent cross-call mutation bleed.
