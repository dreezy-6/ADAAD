## Key messages (keep consistent across all channels)

1. **Lead:** "AI that improves your code — but can't approve its own changes"
2. **Differentiator:** Constitutional governance is architecturally enforced, not just documented
3. **Trust signal:** Deterministic replay — every decision byte-identically reproducible
4. **Phase 6 hook:** The engine proposes changes to its own roadmap. Humans approve.
5. **Access:** Free, open source, MIT, Android app with no Play Store required

---

## Audiences that will resonate most

- Teams in regulated industries (fintech, healthcare, legal tech) where auditability is a requirement
- Security engineers who've had to justify AI-generated code to a compliance team
- DevOps engineers who deal with change management and audit trails
- AI safety researchers interested in practical governance implementations
- Open source developers interested in governance-first architecture
- Android developers interested in zero-cost distribution strategies

## Common questions and answers (for comments/replies)

**Q: Is this just another AI coding assistant?**
A: The key difference is the governance layer. AI assistants suggest changes and let you decide. ADAAD runs a formal constitutional gate before anything is applied, produces a cryptographic evidence bundle for every decision, and makes every decision deterministically replayable. The AI cannot approve its own changes.

**Q: Why three agents instead of one?**
A: Diversity in proposals, same governance gate. Architect tends toward safe, methodical changes. Dream tends toward creative restructuring. Beast pushes complexity limits. They compete — the genetic algorithm picks the fittest. A single agent monoculture produces less interesting candidates.

**Q: What does "deterministic replay" actually mean?**
A: Given the same inputs, the governance pipeline produces byte-identical output. Any past governance decision can be re-run and will produce the exact same verdict. If a replay ever diverges from the original, the pipeline halts immediately. This makes auditing real, not theoretical.

**Q: How is the constitution enforced?**
A: `GovernanceGate` evaluates 16 rules in order. Any BLOCKING rule failure immediately rejects the mutation and logs the failure. There is no way to bypass this — it's not a config flag, it's the only path mutations travel through.

**Q: Can the AI modify its own constitution?**
A: No. The AI can propose a constitutional amendment, but it must pass through the same GovernanceGate as any other change, requires Tier 0 classification (highest oversight), and requires explicit human sign-off before it takes effect.

**Q: What LLM does it use?**
A: Claude (Anthropic API). You bring your own API key. The system is designed around the Claude API but the proposer interface could theoretically be adapted.

**Q: Is the Android app really free?**
A: Yes. MIT license. No Play Store account required. Four install tracks: direct APK from GitHub Releases, Obtainium auto-update, PWA (Chrome), and F-Droid.
