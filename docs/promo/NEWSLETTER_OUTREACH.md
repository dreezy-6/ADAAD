**Subject:** Open-source AI mutation engine with constitutional governance — worth covering?

Hi,

I'm the founder of ADAAD, an open-source project that lets AI agents autonomously propose and apply code improvements — but with a governance layer that makes it auditable and reversible in a way most AI dev tools aren't.

**The one-paragraph pitch:**

ADAAD runs three Claude-powered AI agents (Architect/Dream/Beast) that compete each epoch to propose codebase improvements. The best proposals face a 16-rule constitutional policy engine — one blocking failure halts everything. Every decision is SHA-256 hash-chained into an append-only ledger and deterministically replayable. The latest version (Phase 6) can propose governed amendments to its own development roadmap.

**Why your audience might care:**
- It's completely free and open source (MIT)
- There's a free Android app (no Play Store account required)
- The governance model is genuinely novel for developer tooling — the AI can't approve its own changes
- `python onboard.py` gets you running in ~60 seconds

## Email: Console.dev (developer tools newsletter)

**Subject:** ADAAD — constitutionally governed AI code mutation engine (open source, free)

Hi,

Console covers developer tools worth knowing about — I think ADAAD fits your audience.

**What it is:** An AI mutation engine where three competing Claude-powered agents propose code improvements each epoch, gated by a constitutional policy engine with 16 deterministic rules. Every change is hash-chained, auditable, and replayable.

**What's genuinely new about it:**
The governance model. `GovernanceGate` is the only surface that can approve a change — not the AI agents, not automation, not environment variables. This is architecturally enforced. The constitution is a versioned document in the repo with binding rules the AI cannot modify.

**Phase 6 (just shipped):** The engine can now propose amendments to its own development roadmap, subject to human governor approval. The auto-promote path doesn't exist — it's a constitutional invariant.

**Free, open source, Android app:**
Everything is MIT licensed, $0 to run, and there's a free Android governance dashboard with four install tracks (no Play Store required).

Would love a mention. Happy to write a guest post if that's useful.

## Email: changelog.com / The Changelog

**Subject:** ADAAD — open-source AI code mutation with constitutional governance. Episode idea?

Hi Changelog team,

Long-time listener. I've been building ADAAD — an open-source governed mutation engine — and think it might make for an interesting episode, specifically around the question: "what does responsible AI autonomy actually look like in practice?"

**The core tension we've been building toward:**

Most "AI coding assistant" tools optimize for helpfulness and speed. ADAAD optimizes for auditability and reversibility. The hypothesis is that for teams in regulated industries or with serious code governance requirements, accountability trumps raw throughput.

**Some concrete angles:**
- Why three competing AI agents outperform a single one (diversity in proposals, same governance gate)
- The deterministic replay architecture — every decision byte-identically reproducible
- Phase 6: the engine proposing governed amendments to its own roadmap (with all the constitutional guardrails that entails)
- Multi-repo federation with dual-gate enforcement — why "approved in repo A" never means "approved in repo B"
- The free Android app distribution strategy (GitHub + Obtainium + PWA + F-Droid, zero cost)

## Email: Dev.to / Hashnode (cross-post pitch)

**Subject:** Interested in cross-posting a technical deep-dive on constitutional AI governance?

Hi,

I've written a technical deep-dive on ADAAD's governance architecture — specifically the deterministic replay system, the constitutional rule engine, and the Phase 6 roadmap self-amendment feature.

The post covers:
- Why we chose SHA-256 hash-chaining over a traditional database for the evidence ledger
- How "deterministic replay" is mechanically enforced (not just aspired to)
- The constitutional severity hierarchy (blocking / warning / advisory) and how it maps to three deployment tiers
- Why three competing AI agents with one shared governance gate outperforms a single agent

It's a genuine technical post — no fluff, specific code references, architecture diagrams linked.

Would you be interested in featuring it? Happy to write it fresh for your platform or cross-post with canonical link.

## Email: GitHub Blog / Open Source Friday

**Subject:** ADAAD — open-source constitutional governance for AI code mutation

Hi GitHub team,

I'm the maintainer of ADAAD, an open-source project that uses GitHub infrastructure heavily (GitHub Actions for CI, GitHub Releases for APK distribution, GitHub Pages for the PWA, Obtainium integration pointing to the releases API).

The project might be a good fit for Open Source Friday or a blog mention because it represents a somewhat unusual use of GitHub: not just code hosting, but as the trust infrastructure for a governed AI mutation system.

Specifically: every APK release is signed in CI after passing a governance gate (GitHub Actions). The release artifact includes a SHA-256 hash. Obtainium users get automatic updates pointing to the Releases API. The evidence ledger for governance decisions is committed to the repository as append-only data.

GitHub is, in a sense, the notary for the trust chain.
