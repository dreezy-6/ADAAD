# Evolution Architecture Spec

## Concepts
- **EvolutionRuntime**: constitutional coordinator for epoch lifecycle, governance decisions, lineage digesting, and replay verification.
- **Active epoch state**: persisted at `runtime/evolution/state/current_epoch.json` and treated as the operational source of truth for epoch identity and counters.
- **Lineage**: append-only hash-linked `security/ledger/lineage_v2.jsonl` stream (replay/governance source of truth).
- **Journal projection**: `security/ledger/cryovant_journal.jsonl` is a projection derived from lineage-v2 events.
- **Replay legitimacy**: replay digest must match expected epoch digest checkpoints; mismatches trigger fail-closed.

## Active Epoch State Schema
```json
{
  "epoch_id": "epoch-20260210T140000Z-abc123",
  "start_ts": "2026-02-10T14:00:00Z",
  "mutation_count": 12,
  "metadata": {},
  "governor_version": "3.0.0"
}
```

## Invariants
1. Epoch digest authority is ledger-derived (`EpochCheckpointEvent`), not state-file stored.
2. Every mutation executes inside an active started epoch (`EpochStartEvent` exists and `EpochEndEvent` does not).
3. Epoch transitions emit typed events plus `EpochCheckpointEvent` snapshots.
4. Replay verification emits `ReplayVerificationEvent` with `epoch_digest`, `replay_digest`, and `replay_passed`.
5. Replay divergence forces governor fail-closed and blocks mutation execution until human recovery.
6. Certificates are issued pre-execution and explicitly activated/deactivated after post-mutation tests.

## Governance Policies
### Authority vs impact matrix
- `low-impact`: max impact `0.20`
- `governor-review`: max impact `0.50`
- `high-impact`: max impact `1.00`

### Signature authority
`MutationExecutor` does not perform independent signature checks. Signature authority is centralized in `EvolutionGovernor.validate_bundle`.

### Bundle ID ownership
`MutationRequest.bundle_id` is treated as a proposal hint. Governor certificate stores `bundle_id` and `bundle_id_source` (`request`/`governor`).
When governor-generated, `bundle_id` is deterministic from replay-stable request identity fields (no runtime RNG dependency).

### Replay seed integrity
Governor certificates include `replay_seed` (16 hex chars) used by mutation manifests as a replay witness.
`replay_seed` must never be the all-zero sentinel (`0000000000000000`); both schema validation and runtime execution guards enforce this.

### Strategy anchoring
Certificates include `strategy_snapshot` and `strategy_snapshot_hash`, and cumulative bundle digesting includes those fields.

### Mutation target normalization
`MutationExecutor.execute` preserves backward compatibility for both `MutationRequest.targets` and legacy `MutationRequest.ops`, but both forms are normalized into a shared `MutationTarget[]` plan before applying any file changes.

Rationale: a single transaction gate keeps governance/test/journal/lineage handling consistent across request formats.

Expected invariants:
- all mutation applications run through `MutationTransaction`
- test failures always rollback mutated targets before returning
- mutation lineage payload shape is consistent (`[{path, checksum, applied, skipped}]`) for both request forms

## Runtime Hooks
- `boot()`
- `before_mutation_cycle()`
- `after_mutation_cycle(result)`
- `verify_epoch(epoch_id)`
- `verify_all_epochs()`
- `before_epoch_rotation(reason)`
- `after_epoch_rotation(reason)`

## Rotation Defaults
- `max_mutations = 50`
- `max_duration_minutes = 30`
- force-end when replay divergence occurs


## EvolutionKernel Execution Routing
- `runtime.evolution.evolution_kernel.EvolutionKernel.run_cycle(agent_id=None)` preserves legacy behavior by delegating to `compatibility_adapter.run_cycle(None)` when an adapter is configured and no explicit target agent is requested.
- `run_cycle(agent_id=...)` executes the kernel-native pipeline (`load_agent -> propose_mutation -> validate_mutation -> execute_in_sandbox -> evaluate_fitness -> sign_certificate`) and marks the response with `kernel_path: true`.
- Fitness acceptance and ranking are intentionally separated:
  - **Acceptance** uses base fitness score compared to `fitness_threshold` (default `0.70`).
  - **Ranking** uses objective weighting (`objective_weight`) to prioritize accepted candidates without redefining the acceptance gate.
  - Explainability payloads include weighted contributions and threshold rationale for every decision.
- Agent resolution is canonicalized via `Path.resolve()` for both discovered agent directories and explicit `agent_id` candidate paths to avoid false-negative lookup failures under symlinked or aliased roots.
- Deterministic failure semantics:
  - `RuntimeError("no_agents_available")` when discovery yields no valid agents.
  - `RuntimeError("agent_not_found:<agent_id>")` when explicit target lookup fails after canonicalization.
  - Structured policy rejection payload (`status="rejected", reason="policy_invalid"`) when validation fails.

## Interfaces
- `runtime.evolution.runtime.EvolutionRuntime`
- `runtime.evolution.epoch.EpochManager`
- `runtime.evolution.governor.EvolutionGovernor`
- `runtime.evolution.replay.ReplayEngine`
- `runtime.evolution.lineage_v2.LineageLedgerV2.compute_epoch_digest`
- `runtime.evolution.lineage_v2.LineageLedgerV2.compute_cumulative_epoch_digest`


## Replay Integration Harness Parity
- Determinism integration tests use `EvolutionRuntime.verify_epoch(...)` and `EvolutionRuntime.replay_preflight(...)` directly, then cross-check with `ReplayEngine.replay_epoch(...)` so tests execute the same replay primitives as production.
- Canonical verification artifacts are the lineage cumulative digest (`LineageLedgerV2.get_epoch_digest`) and emitted `ReplayVerificationEvent` payloads; the harness asserts parity instead of maintaining a parallel scoring-only replay implementation.
- Deterministic fixtures are generated from mutation indices and serialized with sorted-key compact JSON before hashing, so fixture manifests and manifest hashes are stable across runs and environments.

## Constitutional Invariants
1. LineageLedgerV2 is the sole source of evolutionary truth.
2. All epoch digests are cumulative chained hashes (`sha256(previous + bundle_digest)`).
3. Replay checks must match lineage cumulative digest exactly.
4. Authority matrix is declarative and governor-enforced.
5. Journal is projection-only and never an authority source.
6. Fail-closed recovery requires explicit recovery tier events.


## Deterministic Entropy Contract
- Replay-sensitive IDs/tokens are generated by `runtime.evolution.entropy_discipline` from stable seed inputs: `epoch_id`, `bundle_id`, and optional `agent_id`.
- In `strict` replay mode and `audit` recovery tier, mutation IDs, epoch suffixes, and dream mutation tokens must be deterministic for identical inputs.
- Outside strict/audit contexts, runtime may use nondeterministic UUID/time entropy only when explicitly enabled via `ADAAD_ALLOW_NONDETERMINISTIC_IDS=1` (or `true/yes/on`).
- Deterministic generation is label-scoped (`mutation`, `epoch`, `dream-mutation`) to avoid collisions across domains while preserving replay equivalence.


## Deterministic Scoring Foundation
- Scoring logic lives in `runtime/evolution/scoring_algorithm.py` with bounded input validation and canonical hashing.
- Payload shape checks live in `runtime/evolution/scoring_validator.py`.
- Append-only scoring evidence chain lives in `runtime/evolution/scoring_ledger.py`.
- Determinism invariant: identical scoring payload + seeded provider => identical score, input hash, and component penalties.


## Promotion Event Model
- Deterministic event IDs derive from `(mutation_id, from_state, to_state, prev_event_hash)` in `runtime/evolution/promotion_events.py`.
- Promotion events are hash-chained with `prev_event_hash` and `event_hash` for replay-stable auditability.
- `MutationExecutor` now emits only legal transitions (`certified -> activated|rejected`) and fails closed when policy resolves to `rejected`.
- Policy evaluation is priority-ordered in `runtime/evolution/promotion_policy.py`; highest matching priority wins and no match resolves to `rejected`.


## Epoch Checkpoint Registry
- `CheckpointRegistry` emits deterministic `EpochCheckpointEvent` records with `ZERO_HASH` genesis anchoring and checkpoint hash chaining.
- `verify_checkpoint_chain(...)` enforces previous-hash continuity and checkpoint hash recomputation.

## Entropy Ceiling Enforcement
- Mutation execution computes deterministic declared entropy metadata from mutation request shape, augments it with observed sandbox/runtime telemetry entropy (e.g., unseeded RNG, wall-clock reads, external IO attempts), persists cumulative epoch entropy in epoch state, and enforces per-mutation/per-epoch ceilings fail-closed.

## Hardened Sandbox Isolation
- Test execution uses `HardenedSandboxExecutor`, records sandbox evidence hashes in append-only ledger storage, and feeds evidence hashes into epoch checkpoint aggregation.
- Sandbox enforcement includes deterministic syscall, filesystem, network, and resource policy checks prior to execution.
- Sandbox replay verification computes deterministic evidence/hash parity via `runtime.sandbox.replay`.

## Android Telemetry → Constitutional Resource Bounds
- During `evaluate_mutation`, the runtime samples `AndroidMonitor.snapshot()` and normalizes it via `runtime.governance.resource_accounting.normalize_platform_telemetry_snapshot`.
- The deterministic envelope state stores merged `platform_telemetry` that `_validate_resources` consumes for `memory_mb`/`cpu_percent` pressure signals plus contextual `battery_percent`/`storage_mb`.
- Merge precedence is conservative and deterministic: memory/cpu use `max(sandbox_observed, android_monitor)`, while battery/storage use `min(...)` to retain the most constrained mobile context.
- Resource usage enforcement still resolves hard limits through `coalesce_resource_usage_snapshot(...)` and blocks fail-closed when bounds are exceeded.
