# Wood + Fire (app) ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/App-Stable-2ea043)

The app layer orchestrates boot order and creative/evaluative cycles. Architect (Wood) scans agents for required metadata, while Dream and Beast (Fire) run mutation and evaluation loops. All operations must honor Cryovant gating and log to `reports/metrics.jsonl`.

> The app package is the orchestration shell around ADAAD runtime governance components.
> It should coordinate boot lifecycle and mutation execution handoffs without owning canonical governance primitives.
> Keep this layer thin, deterministic, and boundary-safe.

> **Doc metadata:** Audience: Contributor · Last validated release: `v1.0.0`

> ✅ **Do this:** Keep orchestration responsibilities in `app/*` and delegate policy/replay primitives to `runtime/*`.
>
> ⚠️ **Caveat:** Coupling orchestrators directly to `app.main` internals breaks import-boundary guarantees.
>
> 🚫 **Out of scope:** Do not add new business logic to compatibility shims or legacy module-level adapter paths.


## Canonical entrypoint contract ![Internal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contract-Internal-blue)

- Canonical platform entrypoint: `python -m app.main` (`app/main.py`).
- `app/mutation_executor.py` is the pure execution engine and should remain UI/entrypoint agnostic.
- `adaad/orchestrator/*` is orchestration/wiring only. Any direct `app.main` coupling is forbidden.
- Legacy module-level compatibility paths are adapter-only and must not grow business logic.
- Dispatcher call sites in orchestration paths must fail closed on non-success envelopes before reading `result` payloads (deterministic `dispatch failed:<code>` RuntimeError on error/missing result/explicit non-success result status).
- Dispatch guard failures should be observable via dispatcher logger records to preserve triage/audit visibility for rejected envelopes.
- See `docs/ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md` for ownership and enforcement boundaries.


### Enforcement

These constraints are enforced by `tools/lint_import_paths.py` (rule id: `layer_boundary_violation`) and the always-on CI job `import-boundary-lint`.
Relative imports that resolve to forbidden modules are also blocked.

Legitimate exceptions require updating both `tools/lint_import_paths.py` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md` in the same PR with rationale.
