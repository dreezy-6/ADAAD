# ADAAD Roadmap

> **Constitutional principle:** Every item on this roadmap must be approved by ArchitectAgent before implementation, governed by the mutation pipeline before merge, and evidenced in the release notes before promotion.

## What ships today — v3.0.0

The self-improving loop is live. Three AI agents compete. The fittest mutations survive. Weights adapt. Evidence is permanent.

| `EpochTelemetry` | ✅ shipped | Append-only analytics engine, health indicators |
| MCP Evolution Tools | ✅ shipped | 5 read-only observability endpoints for the pipeline |
| `GovernanceGate` | ✅ shipped | Constitutional authority — the only surface that approves mutations |
| Evidence Ledger | ✅ shipped | Append-only, SHA-256 hash-chained, replay-proof |

## Phase 3 — Adaptive Penalty Weights

**Status:** ✅ shipped (v2.1.0)

Currently `risk_penalty` (0.20) and `complexity_penalty` (0.10) are static. Phase 3 makes them adaptive by harvesting post-merge telemetry:

- **`WeightAdaptor` Phase 2 unlock** — Extend momentum-descent to include `risk_penalty` and `complexity_penalty` using post-merge outcome data from the evidence ledger.
- **Telemetry feedback loop** — `EpochTelemetry` drives weight adjustments: if high-risk mutations consistently underperform, `risk_penalty` climbs; if complexity is rarely determinative, it decays.
- **Thompson Sampling activation** — `ThompsonBanditSelector` (already implemented, not yet wired) activates as an alternative to UCB1 when non-stationary reward is detected across ≥30 epochs.
- **Gate:** ArchitectAgent approval + `≥30 epoch` data requirement before Phase 2 weight activation.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `risk_penalty` and `complexity_penalty` in `[0.05, 0.70]` bounds at all times
- Weight trajectory stored in telemetry for every epoch
- `WeightAdaptor.prediction_accuracy > 0.60` by epoch 20

## Phase 4 — Semantic Mutation Diff Engine

**Target:** v2.2.0 ✅ · Requires: Phase 3 shipped

Replace the heuristic complexity/risk scoring with AST-aware semantic analysis:

- **`SemanticDiffEngine`** (`runtime/autonomy/semantic_diff.py`) — AST-based mutation diff: counts node insertions/deletions, detects control-flow changes, measures cyclomatic complexity delta.
- **Risk scoring upgrade** — Replace `mutation_risk_scorer.py`'s regex heuristics with semantic parse-tree analysis. Score is now: `(ast_depth_delta × 0.3) + (cyclomatic_delta × 0.4) + (import_surface_delta × 0.3)`.
- **Lineage confidence scoring** — Mutations that are semantically close to previous accepted mutations get a lineage bonus; semantically novel mutations get an exploration bonus.
- **Gate:** Requires semantic diff to produce identical scores on identical AST inputs (determinism CI job).

---

## Phase 5 — Multi-Repo Federation

**Status:** ✅ shipped (v3.0.0)

Extends ADAAD from single-repo mutation to governed cross-repo evolution:

- **HMAC Key Validation (M-05)** — `key_registry.py` enforces minimum-length key at boot; fail-closed on absent key material.
- **Cross-repo lineage** — `LineageLedgerV2` extended with `federation_origin` field; mutations carry their source-repo epoch chain.
- **FederationMutationBroker** — Governed cross-repo mutation propagation; GovernanceGate approval required in BOTH source and destination repos.
- **FederatedEvidenceMatrix** — Cross-repo determinism verification gate; `divergence_count == 0` required before promotion.
- **EvolutionFederationBridge + ProposalTransportAdapter** — Lifecycle wiring for broker and evidence matrix within `EvolutionRuntime`.
- **Federated evidence bundle** — Release gate output includes `federated_evidence` section; non-zero divergence_count blocks promotion.
- **Federation Determinism CI** — `.github/workflows/federation_determinism.yml` enforces 0-divergence invariant on every PR touching federation paths.
- **HMAC key rotation runbook** — `docs/runbooks/hmac_key_rotation.md` operational documentation.

## Phase 6 — Autonomous Roadmap Self-Amendment

**Status:** 🟡 active · **Target:** v3.1.0 · Promoted from backlog: 2026-03-06

The mutation engine proposes amendments to this roadmap itself. Phase 5 delivery confirms the constitutional and determinism infrastructure required for this capability is now in place.

**Active development targets for v3.1.0:**

- ADAAD runs an evolution epoch against the codebase and roadmap simultaneously.
- If the Architect agent identifies that Phase N+1 prerequisites are met and Phase N targets were achieved, it proposes a `ROADMAP.md` mutation advancing the milestone.
- The mutation is governed like any other: GovernanceGate, constitutional compliance, replay proof, federated evidence matrix verification.
- A human governance sign-off is required for any roadmap mutation — the system cannot self-promote without human approval.
- **Phase 5 prerequisite fulfilled:** FederatedEvidenceMatrix and FederationMutationBroker provide the cross-repo propagation surface needed for roadmap self-amendment to operate safely across a federation.

This closes the loop: ADAAD evolves its own evolution plan, under the same constitutional constraints it applies to every other change.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `ROADMAP.md` mutation proposed by ArchitectAgent, governed through full pipeline
- Replay proof attached to roadmap amendment commit
- Human sign-off recorded in governance ledger before merge
- Federation evidence section non-empty for cross-repo roadmap propagation

## Measurement targets

| Milestone | Metric | Target |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Phase 3 activation | `prediction_accuracy` | > 0.60 by epoch 20 |
| Phase 3 activation | Acceptance rate | 0.20–0.60 stable |
| Phase 4 semantic diff | Scoring determinism | 100% identical on identical AST |
| Phase 5 federation | Cross-repo divergence | 0 divergences per federated epoch ✅ |
| Phase 6 roadmap self-amendment | ArchitectAgent proposal governed | Human sign-off recorded in ledger |
| All phases | Evidence matrix | 100% Complete before promotion |
| All phases | Replay proofs | 0 divergences in CI |

## What will not be built

To maintain constitutional clarity:

- **No autonomous promotion** — The pipeline never promotes a mutation to production without human sign-off. GovernanceGate cannot be delegated.
- **No non-deterministic entropy** in governance decisions — Randomness is only allowed in agent proposals (seeded from epoch_id), never in scoring or gate evaluation.
- **No retroactive evidence** — Evidence cannot be added after a release is tagged.
- **No silent failures** — Every pipeline halt produces a named failure mode in the evidence ledger.
