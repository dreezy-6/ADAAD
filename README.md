## What is ADAAD?

**ADAAD** (Autonomous Device-Anchored Adaptive Development) is an open-source AI governance and autonomous code mutation system built by **[InnovativeAI LLC](https://github.com/InnovativeAI-adaad)**.

It was conceived, designed, and architected entirely by **Dustin L. Reid** — Founder of InnovativeAI LLC and sole architect of ADAAD — with the conviction that autonomous AI systems must be governed by hard rules, not soft suggestions.

> *"Autonomy without accountability isn't progress — it's drift. ADAAD makes every decision traceable, every mutation defensible, and every failure visible."*
> — **Dustin L. Reid**, Founder, InnovativeAI LLC

## What ADAAD does

Three Claude-powered AI agents continuously propose code improvements. Those proposals compete in a genetic-algorithm population — crossed, mutated, and ranked. The fittest candidates advance to a **constitutional gate**: 16 deterministic rules, evaluated in order. One blocking failure halts everything.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/adaad-flow.svg" width="860" alt="ADAAD mutation pipeline: propose → simulate → replay-verify → policy gate → execute → evidence"/>
</p>

After every epoch, scoring weights self-calibrate via momentum gradient descent. Mutation strategies that perform well gain influence. Underperformers decay. **The system learns which kinds of improvements are worth making — without ever bypassing governance.**

---

## Three agents. One loop.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/adaad-agents.svg" width="680" alt="Architect, Dream, and Beast agent personas"/>
</p>

| Agent | Personality | Focus |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 🏛️ **Architect** | Systematic, structural | Long-term coherence, dependency cleanup, interface contracts |
| 💭 **Dream** | Creative, exploratory | Novel approaches, experimental rewrites, lateral improvements |
| 🐉 **Beast** | Aggressive, performance-first | Throughput gains, complexity reduction, raw optimization |

Each agent competes on merit inside the same governed pipeline. The **GovernanceGate** evaluates all three identically — no agent gets special treatment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `GovernanceGate` is the **only** surface that can approve, sign, or execute a mutation. Fitness scores influence selection — but approval authority belongs exclusively to constitutional evaluation. This is architecturally enforced, not just documented.

## ⚡ Start in 60 seconds

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InnovativeAI-adaad/ADAAD.git
cd ADAAD
python onboard.py
```

> **Requirements:** Python 3.11.9 · pip · git

`onboard.py` handles everything: environment setup, workspace init, schema validation, and a governed dry-run. Every step is idempotent — safe to re-run at any time.

<details>
<summary><strong>What onboarding does, step by step</strong></summary>

<br/>

```
onboard.py
  │
  ├─ 1. Verify Python 3.11.9
  ├─ 2. Create .venv + install dependencies
  ├─ 3. Set ADAAD_ENV=dev  (safe default)
  ├─ 4. Initialize workspace  (nexus_setup.py)
  ├─ 5. Validate governance schemas
  ├─ 6. Run governed dry-run
  │      python -m app.main --dry-run --replay audit
  └─ 7. Print your personalized next steps
```

Successful output:

```
✔ Python 3.11.9
✔ Virtual environment ready
✔ Dependencies installed
✔ ADAAD_ENV=dev
✔ Workspace initialized
✔ Governance schemas valid
✔ Dry-run complete — no files modified

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ADAAD is ready.

  Run the dashboard:   python server.py
  Run an epoch:        python -m app.main --verbose
  Explore the docs:    docs/README.md

## How the loop works

```python
from runtime.autonomy.ai_mutation_proposer import CodebaseContext
from runtime.evolution.evolution_loop import EvolutionLoop
import os

loop = EvolutionLoop(
    api_key=os.environ["ADAAD_CLAUDE_API_KEY"],
    generations=3,
)

context = CodebaseContext(
    file_summaries={"runtime/autonomy/mutation_scaffold.py": "Scoring engine."},
    recent_failures=[],
    current_epoch_id="epoch-001",
)

result = loop.run_epoch(context)

print(f"Proposals:   {result.total_candidates}")
print(f"Accepted:    {result.accepted_count}")
print(f"Next agent:  {result.recommended_next_agent}")
print(f"Accuracy:    {result.weight_accuracy:.1%}")
print(f"Duration:    {result.duration_seconds:.1f}s")
```

> [!NOTE]
> Replay mode is always on. Every decision above can be re-run with `--replay audit` to verify byte-identical outputs. Divergence from the original run halts the pipeline and logs the exact delta.

## Platform capabilities

<table>
<tr>
  <td><strong>🔁&nbsp; Deterministic Replay</strong></td>
  <td>Every decision re-runs byte-identical. Divergence halts the pipeline and is logged in the evidence ledger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>🛡️&nbsp; Constitutional Gating</strong></td>
  <td>16 governance rules evaluated per mutation across three tiers (Sandbox / Stable / Production). One blocking failure = full halt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>🧾&nbsp; Append-Only Evidence Ledger</strong></td>
  <td>Every governed step is SHA-256 hash-chained, signed, and permanently attached. No retroactive modification possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>🤖&nbsp; AI Mutation Proposals</strong></td>
  <td>Three Claude-powered agents (Architect / Dream / Beast) produce diverse, scored candidates each epoch via the Anthropic API.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>📈&nbsp; Self-Calibrating Weights</strong></td>
  <td>Scoring weights adapt via momentum gradient descent across epochs. Underperforming strategies decay automatically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>🧬&nbsp; Genetic Population Evolution</strong></td>
  <td>BLX-alpha crossover, elite preservation, and diversity enforcement per generation. UCB1 bandit selects agent strategy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>🗺️&nbsp; Fitness Landscape Memory</strong></td>
  <td>Win/loss rates tracked per mutation type. Plateau detection triggers exploration mode via Thompson sampling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>🧪&nbsp; Policy Simulation</strong></td>
  <td>Replay historical epochs under hypothetical constraints — zero side-effects, full audit trail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>🐳&nbsp; Container Isolation</strong></td>
  <td>cgroup v2 sandboxes — pool-managed, health-probed, lifecycle-audited. Resource bounds are a blocking constitutional rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>🌐&nbsp; Multi-Node Federation</strong></td>
  <td>Cross-repo mutations with dual-gate constitutional enforcement. Divergence in any node blocks promotion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>📝&nbsp; Roadmap Self-Amendment</strong></td>
  <td>The engine proposes changes to its own roadmap. Humans approve. No auto-merge path exists — by constitutional invariant.</td>
</tr>

## Governance model

ADAAD's governance isn't configuration — it's architecture. The hierarchy is strict and cannot be bypassed:

```
Constitution  →  Architecture Contract  →  ArchitectAgent Spec  →  PR Procession
```

- **[Constitution](docs/CONSTITUTION.md)** — 14 hard rules. Cannot be overridden by any agent, operator, or PR.
- **[Architecture Contract](docs/ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md)** — Interface and boundary invariants across all modules.
- **[ArchitectAgent Spec v3.1.0](docs/governance/ARCHITECT_SPEC_v3.1.0.md)** — Canonical spec for the Phase 6 governance baseline; Phase 6.1 active hardening lane.
- **[PR Procession Plan](docs/governance/ADAAD_PR_PROCESSION_2026-03.md)** — Controlling source for PR order, CI tier, and closure state.
